<h1>About this website</h1>

<p>
<cite>Unplanned Obsolescence</cite> is a blog from <a href="https://alexanderpetros.com/">Alexander
  Petros</a>. It's his second blog, because his <a href="https://thefloatingcontinent.com/">first
  blog</a> didn't feel like the right place to rant about software lifespans, open source
development, and HTML.

<p>
Professionally, Alex is a core maintainer for <a href="https://htmx.org/">htmx</a> and software
engineer based in New York City. He is currently at <a href="https://www.recurse.com/scout/click?t=044d120abf1c334d0b2a3132634eb025">Recurse Center</a>, coding, writing, and meeting lots of interesting people in software.



<p>He is also freelancing, building software infrastructure for
non-software companies, developing a set of practices for building software infrastructure that
lasts a <em>really</em> long time with <em>very</em> little maintenance.

<p>
At some point he would like to do the same for municipal, state, and federal governments.

<p>
You can find all his links and socials at <a href="https://alexanderpetros.com">alexanderpetros.com</a> (but here's <a href="https://github.com/alexpetros">the GitHub</a>, since it's relevant).
