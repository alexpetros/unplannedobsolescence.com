you click the button below, it‚Äôs going to show you a little message.\n\nClick me\nShowing a pop-up when the user clicks a button isn‚Äôt something the button supports on its own; you\nhave to code it. There are two ways to attach custom functionality to an HTML element: inline, or\nusing an event listener.\nThis is how you‚Äôd do it with an inline handler:\n&lt;button onclick=\"alert('I was clicked!')\"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;\n\nAnd this is how you‚Äôd do it with an event listener:\n&lt;button&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\nconst btn = document.querySelector(\"button\")\n\nbtn.addEventListener(\"click\", () =&gt; {\n  alert('I was clicked!')\n})\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nIf you‚Äôve never thought about this before, your likely reaction is that the first example (inline)\nseems better. It takes up way less space and puts all the relevant information right on the button.\nNot so, according to the experts. The MDN Web Docs have this to say about\nusing inline event handlers:\n\nYou can find HTML attribute equivalents for many of the event handler properties; however, you\nshouldn‚Äôt use these ‚Äî they are considered bad practice. It might seem easy to use an event\nhandler attribute if you are doing something really quick, but they quickly become unmanageable\nand inefficient.\n\nOr, in case that wasn‚Äôt clear enough:\n\nYou should never use the HTML event handler attributes ‚Äî those are outdated, and using them is bad\npractice. (emphasis theirs)\n\nThis is, in my polite opinion, completely wrong. The novices are right on this one. MDN is a\ntremendous resource, and I understand why they recommend the second form, but combating this\nparticular ideology is essential to rehabilitating HTML‚Äôs full functionality, and building durable\napplications with it. I‚Äôll explain.\n&lt;form&gt; and function\nMDN does not want you to use inline event handlers because they don‚Äôt want you to mix form (HTML)\nand function (JS). This is a programming principle called Separation of\nConcerns and the\nHTML/CSS/JS split is a textbook example of it. From Wikipedia (at the time of this writing):\n\nHTML is mainly used for organization of webpage content, CSS is used for definition of\ncontent presentation style, and JS defines how the content interacts and behaves with the user.\n\nSeparation of Concerns is a great principle, but I think they drew the line in the wrong place. In\nthis conception of the web page, HTML is essentially the scaffolding that you dress up with CSS (for\nstyle) and JS (for interactivity). But HTML is inherently interactive, too. It‚Äôs sufficiently\ninteractive to power billion-dollar businesses without a single line of JavaScript.\nLet‚Äôs say you want to set up a text box and a search button so that people can search the web.\nYou‚Äôd start with an &lt;input type=text&gt; for the text box, and a &lt;button&gt; to search.\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;input type=text name=q&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nOn the page it looks like this:\n\n  \n  Search\n\nThat button doesn‚Äôt do anything; the text goes nowhere. But if you replace the &lt;div&gt; with a\n&lt;form&gt;, like so:\n&lt;form method=/search action=GET&gt;\n  &lt;input type=text name=q&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\nthen clicking the button submits your input as a query, and navigates to the result. So if you‚Äôre on\nhttp://example.com and the text box has cats in it, clicking submit will navigate you to\nhttp://example.com/search?q=cats. The Google homepage worked exactly like\nthis for a very long time.\nHTML defined that functionality in its entirety. The page does something interactive‚Äîit makes a\nnetwork request using your input, when you click the button‚Äîand no JavaScript was involved. It‚Äôs\neasy to read, semantic, and will work in every web browser forever. Most importantly, it\ndemonstrates that the entire concept of ‚ÄúHTML defines the layout, JS defines the functionality‚Äù is\ndefinitionally incorrect.\nEnhancing the semantics\nThe problem with doing everything this way is that the functionality of HTML is extraordinarily\nlimited, and to augment that functionality we need JavaScript. Form validation is a great example.\nThis form is a lot like the previous one, only now it asks for an email address of at least 8\ncharacters:\n&lt;form&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"email\" id=\"mail\" name=\"mail\" required minlength=\"8\" /&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\nThat will get the job done, sort of. It will keep the user from submitting something that is too\nshort, or doesn‚Äôt look like an email, but it won‚Äôt let you customize how the user is informed about\nthe requirements of the email address. This form, adapted for clarity from the MDN page on form\nvalidation,\ndemonstrates how to do that:\n&lt;form novalidate&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"email\" id=\"mail\" name=\"mail\" required minlength=\"8\" /&gt;\n  &lt;span class=\"error\" aria-live=\"polite\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\nNow there is a &lt;span&gt; that starts off empty, but will be populated with an error message if the\nemail is invalid. There‚Äôs also a novalidate attribute on the form that tells the browser not to do\nHTML‚Äôs built-in validation because we‚Äôre going to do it all ourselves in JavaScript. And here is the\nJavaScript that decides what the message is going to be, and adds it to the span.\nconst form = document.querySelector(\"form\");\nconst email = document.getElementById(\"mail\");\nconst emailError = document.querySelector(\"#mail + span.error\");\n\nemail.addEventListener(\"input\", (event) =&gt; {\n\n  if (email.validity.valid) {\n    emailError.textContent = \"\";\n    emailError.className = \"error\";\n  } else {\n    showError();\n  }\n});\n\nform.addEventListener(\"submit\", (event) =&gt; {\n  if (!email.validity.valid) {\n    showError();\n    event.preventDefault();\n  }\n});\n\nfunction showError() {\n  if (email.validity.valueMissing) {\n    emailError.textContent = \"You need to enter an email address.\";\n  } else if (email.validity.typeMismatch) {\n    emailError.textContent = \"Entered value needs to be an email address.\";\n  } else if (email.validity.tooShort) {\n    emailError.textContent = `Email should be at least ${email.minLength} characters; you entered ${email.value.length}.`;\n  }\n\n  emailError.className = \"error active\";\n}\n\nThat code enhances the HTML so that it does the following things:\n\nIf the user submits an invalid email, show them an error message\nIf the email was empty, show ‚ÄúYou need to enter an email address.‚Äù\nIf the email was too short, show ‚ÄúEmail should be at least 8 characters; you entered X‚Äù (where X\nis the number of characters they entered)\nIf the email was not an email, show ‚ÄúEntered value needs to be an email address.‚Äù\nWhen the user starts typing, remove the error message\n\nAll those things aren‚Äôt built into HTML, which is why you have to write them in JavaScript. A lot of\nJavaScript. But what if they were? Hypothetically, you could design the following interface in the\nHTML itself:\n&lt;form&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"email\"\n         name=\"mail\"\n         required\n         minlength=\"8\"\n         message-target=\"#email-error\"\n         value-missing-message=\"You need to enter an email address.\"\n         type-mismatch-message=\"Entered value needs to be an email address.\"\n         too-short-message=\"Email should be at least ${email.minLength} characters; you entered ${email.value.length}.\"\n  &gt;\n  &lt;span id=email-error&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\nInstead of adding new messages in JavaScript, you write them on the input itself. That‚Äôs better, for\na couple reasons:\n\nThe code is legible. Where is the ‚Äúinput too short‚Äù message defined? In too-short-messsage.\nThe behavior is local. It‚Äôs impossible not to\nsee that someone changed the message, and where they did it.\nThe logic can be trivially re-used on different inputs\nThe interface automatically implements the aria-live\ndesignation that is appropriate for a validation message (in this case, polite)\n\nIn some sense these are all the same advantage: they give HTML richer semantics.\nHopefully you‚Äôre howling at your computer screen about this. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt solve anything! Doing\nvalidation is complex and you just magic wanded it away by designing a perfect interface for it.‚Äù\nYes. Exactly. That is what interfaces are supposed to do. Better semantics make it possible for the\nprogrammer to describe what the element does, and for someone else to take care of the details for\nthem.\nI‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre not going to have to write JavaScript‚Äîsomeone‚Äôs got to write\nJavaScript‚Äîbut if we start writing our\nJavaScript libraries to enrich HTML‚Äôs semantics, rather than replace them, we might get a lot more\nmileage out of both.\nKeep in mind that, at this stage, the custom semantics I‚Äôm using are still purely theoretical.\nWe‚Äôll talk about forwards compatibility, data- attributes, and all the hard details in a moment.\nThe first task is to acknowledge that HTML, as a hypertext markup language, is inherently\nfunctional: the ‚Äúhyper‚Äù denotes all the extra functionality, like links and forms, that we add to\nthe text. You need to take HTML\nseriously to build good interfaces for\nit.\nOnce we do that, the task ahead is to figure out how best to augment its limited semantics with our\nown. That part is hard.\nBack to reality\nOkay, so if we want to enrich HTML‚Äôs semantics, what are the right ways to do it?\nThe main concern here is that as HTML is both a living standard and a mercilessly backwards\ncompatible one (it‚Äôs a remarkable accomplishment that the first website\never is still online and displays perfectly on\nmodern web browsers). So if I add too-short-messsage to my input element, and then a couple years\nin the future WHATWG adds a new too-short-messsage attribute, the page will\nstart to break in unexpected ways.\nMicroformats are a very old standard that still gets some use today,\nperhaps most notably as part of the Webmentions specification.\nThey let you add add properties as class declarations, like this:\n&lt;a class=\"p-name u-url\" href=\"https://alexpetros.com\"&gt;Alex Petros&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSomething parsing the webpage will know that this link isn‚Äôt just a random link, it‚Äôs a link with my\nname as the text (p-name), and that person‚Äôs home page as the URL (u-url). This is nifty but\nvery limited. You could not implement a custom message using class names like this.\nHTML solves this problem by reserving the data- prefix for custom\nattributes. This works\nfine, and some custom attribute libraries like Turbo embrace it. Take\nthis example from their\ndocumentation, which\nuses the data-turbo-method attribute to change a link‚Äôs method from GET to DELETE (I make no\nclaims about whether that‚Äôs a thing you should do):\n&lt;a href=\"/articles/54\" data-turbo-method=\"delete\"&gt;Delete the article&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd that works! That will never get overwritten by future updates to the HTML standard. If you want\nto write your whole attribute library that way, you can.\nIf I sound a little ambivalent about it, it‚Äôs because I think everything about data-* attributes,\nfrom their name to the examples people\nuse, suggests that\nthey are meant to store data, not behavior. You can of course just barrel ahead and extend HTML with\nit, but the name and the verbosity really does discourage people from building semantics with it. If\nyou say that data attribues are for ‚Äúdata that should be associated with a particular element but\nneed not have any defined\nmeaning,‚Äù then\npeople will use them that way.\nWe know this is true because some very popular JavaScript libraries eschew the data- attributes\naltogether and just add custom attributes with prefixes that are very unlikely to be added to\nHTML. Classic AngularJS uses ng-, which is still all over the internet\ntoday; Alpine.js prefixes its 15 custom attributes with x-;\nhtmx does the same with hx- (although AngularJS and htmx both support\nprepending their prefix with data-, just for the pedants).\nBrowsers have supported this, unofficially for ages, and it also works well. Here‚Äôs a button that\ntoggles some arbitrary property using Alpine.js:\n&lt;button x-on:click=\"open = ! open\"&gt;Toggle&lt;/button&gt;\n\nThis is, in my opinion, the right general idea, even though I (subjectively) dislike almost\neverything about it. I find the open = ! open sort of weird (it‚Äôs a global variable I guess?),\nhaving to namespace with x- is still a small kludge, and overall it deviates from HTML semantics\nin a way I don‚Äôt vibe with. It‚Äôs a very safe bet that WHATWG is not going to add x-on:click, but\nit‚Äôs also, at the time of this writing, not a guarantee.\nCustom attributes are (still) the way\nIn 2009, during the HTML5 specification process, John Allsop advocated for taking seriously the\npossibility of custom attributes in his blog ‚ÄúSemantics in HTML\n5‚Äù.\n\nInstead of new elements, HTML 5 should adopt a number of new attributes. Each of these attributes\nwould relate to a category or type of semantics. For example, as I‚Äôve detailed in another article,\nHTML includes structural semantics, rhetorical semantics, role semantics (adopted from XHTML), and\nother classes or categories of semantics.\nThese new attributes could then be used much as the class attribute is used: to attach to an element\nsemantics that describe the nature of the element, or to add metadata about the element.\n\nHe includes a couple examples, like one where you markup a paragraph as being ironic (I thought this\nwas a ridiculous example until I remembered that people actually do this all the\ntime, informally, with stuff like ‚Äú/s‚Äù):\n&lt;p rhetoric=\"irony\"&gt;He‚Äôs a fantastic person.&lt;/p&gt;\n\nOr this one that would let you specify times in a machine-paresable format (later solved with the\nintroduction of the &lt;time&gt;\nelement):\n&lt;span equivalent=‚Äú2009-05-01‚Äù&gt;May Day next year&lt;/span&gt;\n\nThis was the right path. The thing says what it is, and specifies machine-parseable semantics in the\nmost human-readable way (although ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù was a terrible name choice in that case).\nThere are still a lot of questions that need to be answered to make this work properly, which Allsop\nalso acknowledged at the time:\n\nI titled this section ‚Äúsome thoughts on a solution‚Äù because a significant amount of work needs to\nbe done to really develop a workable solution. Open questions include the following.\n\nHow many distinct semantic attributes should there be? Should these categories be extensible,\nand if so, how?\nHow are vocabularies determined?\nDo we simply invent the terms we want, in much the same way that developers have been using\nclass values, or should the possible values all be determined by a standardized specification? Or\nshould there be a mechanism for inventing (and hopefully sharing) vocabularies, using some kind of\nprofile?\nIf we have a conflict between two vocabularies, such that two identical terms are defined by two\ndifferent vocabularies, how is this resolved?\nDo we need a form of name spacing, or does some other mechanism exist?\n\n\nMany of these questions still don‚Äôt have good answers, because the field of web development mostly\nlet this question go stale during its ‚Äúscrew it, JavaScript everything‚Äù phase. You don‚Äôt need to\nextend the behavior of a form if you rewrite it every\ntime. As we start to exit that\nera, I propose that we pick up where Allsop left off and begin doing to the work making HTML a\nsafely extensible hypertext system.\nOne thing we can do immediately officially sanction is kebab-case attributes, roughly in line with\nthis proposal (h/t to Deniz\nAk≈üim≈üek for showing me this). This would not only bless many of the\nmost popular HTML-enhancing frameworks, and therefore huge chunks of existing code on the internet,\nwith valid HTML, it would legitimatize the project of extending HTML with user- or library-defined\nsemantics.\nOkay Alex, how would you extend that button?\nRemember the button from the beginning?\nClick me\nIf you want to make a lot of buttons that display click messages, the best way to do that isn‚Äôt with\nonclick or an event listener, it‚Äôs to enhance the button so that you can turn any button into a\nmessage button.\n&lt;button alert message=\"I was clicked\"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;\n\n&lt;script&gt;\n// Get all the buttons with the 'alert' attribute\nconst buttons = document.querySelectorAll('button[alert]')\nbuttons.forEach(btn =&gt; {\n  // Get the message property of the button\n  const message = btn.getAttribute('message')\n  // Set the button to alert that message when clicked\n  btn.addEventListener('click', () =&gt; { alert(message) })\n})\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nThis has the advantage of being re-usable across any button in your document. For less trivial\napplications, you can bundle that behavior into a library with a very nice interface (probably with\na prefix, for now).\nIf you only need to do it for one or two buttons, though, just use onclick. It‚Äôs less\ncode, it doesn‚Äôt require that you specify an id, and it doesn‚Äôt make you hunt to a different part\nof the codebase to see what it does. Those are all ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù in my book.\nNotes\nThanks to Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek for reading a draft of this blog.\n\nImplementing the tooShortMessage and related attributes is left as an exercise to the reader.\nEven better, for the button example, would probably be type=alert, because that extends the\nexisting semantics, but I\nreally don‚Äôt want to get into how you‚Äôd approach namespacing that for forwards compatibility.\nIronically, attribute interfaces have a much better case against being defined inline than the\ndocument.getElementById style of adding functionality, because the code that enables the\ninterfaces can actually be re-used generically across elements.\nSome people think ‚Äúcustom semantics‚Äù is an oxymoron, because if it‚Äôs not in the HTML standard it‚Äôs\nnot ‚Äúsemantic‚Äù. That‚Äôs not really what semantics are. Semantics describe the expressive power of\nsomething. Think of it like a language: whether something is or isn‚Äôt a language has nothing to do\nwith how many people speak it; that only affects how useful learning that language is going to be.\nUser-defined semantics may be non-standard (at least until they adopted officially), but they\nare still semantics.\nA lot of people really hate seeing even tiny amounts of JS syntax in attribute declarations. I\nthink this is a little silly, but I do understand it. I‚Äôll write on that subject in the future.\n\nDiscuss this blog on: HackerNews\n","id":"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/behavior-belongs-in-html/","title":"Behavior Belongs in the HTML"},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/best-hello-world-web-development/":{"body":"The Classic Hello World\nHere‚Äôs how you make a webpage that says ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù in PHP:\nHello World\n\nName that file index.php and you‚Äôre set.

It‚Äôs setting up a unit test framework, a blog content folder, a database schema, whatever credentials.yml.enc is,  and so on. If I wanted all of that, then Rails might be the way to go. But right now I want to make a webpage that says ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù and start adding content to it; I should not have to figure out what a Gemfile is to do that.\nAs a reminder, here‚Äôs the directory structure for our ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù in PHP:\n$ tree -L 2 php-project\nphp-project\n‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.php\n\n1 directory, 1 file\n\nMy goal here isn‚Äôt to rip on Ruby on Rails‚Äîalthough, is a Dockerfile really necessary when you‚Äôre just ‚ÄúGetting Started‚Äù?‚Äîbut to highlight a problem that is shared by basically every general-purpose programming language: using Ruby for web development requires a discomfiting amount of scaffolding.\nOver in the Python ecosystem, one of the first web development frameworks you will encounter is flask, which is a much lighter-weight framework than Rails. In flask, you can also get the ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù down to one file, sort of:\nfrom flask import Flask\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route(\"/\")\ndef hello_world():\n    return \"Hello World\"\n\nEven here, there are a ton of concepts to wrap your head around: you have to understand basic coding constructs like ‚Äúfunctions‚Äù and ‚Äúimports‚Äù, as well as Python‚Äôs syntax for describing these things; you have to figure out how to install Python, how to install Python packages like flask, and how to run Python environment management tool like venv (a truly bizarre kludge that Python developers insist isn‚Äôt that big of a deal but is absolutely insane if you come from any other modern programming environment); I know we said one file earlier, but if you want this work on a server you‚Äôre going to have to document that you installed flask, using a file like requirements.txt; when you start to add more content you‚Äôre going to have to figure out how to do multiline strings; and what‚Äôs going with the inscrutable app = Flask(__name__)?\nIf any of these concepts aren‚Äôt arranged properly‚Äîin your head and in your file‚Äîyour server will display nothing.\nBy contrast, you don‚Äôt have to know a thing about PHP to start writing PHP code. Hell, you barely have to know the command line. If you can manage to install and run a PHP server this file will simply display in your browser.\nAnd the file itself:\nHello World\n\nYou didn‚Äôt have to think about dependencies, or routing, or import, or language constructs, or any of that stuff. You‚Äôre just running PHP. And you‚Äôre on the web.\nThe Importance of Time-To-Hello-World\nThe Time-To-Hello-World test is about the time between when you have an idea and when you are able to see the seed of its expression. That time is crucial‚Äîit‚Äôs when your idea is in its most mortal state.\nYears before my friend Morry really knew how to code, he was able to kludge together enough PHP of make a website that tells you whether your IP address has 69 in it. It basically looks like this:\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;Does my IP address have 69 in it?&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Does my IP address have 69 in it?&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;?php\nif(strpos($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], '69') !== false) {\n  echo \"Nice\";\n} else{\n  echo \"Not Nice\";\n}\n?&gt;\n\nYou may or may not find that to be a compelling work of art, but it would not exist if spinning up Flask boilerplate were a requirement to do it. And he had taken a CS course in basic Python; the experience of making a website in PHP was just that much better. This turned out to be the first in a long line of internet art projects, some of which we made together and some of which he did on his own.\ndoesmyipaddresshave69init.com is a dumb idea for a website. But sometimes dumb ideas evolve into good ideas, or they teach you something that‚Äôs later used to make a good idea, or they just make you chuckle. Or none of the above. The best thing about websites is that you don‚Äôt have to justify them to anyone‚Äîyou can just make them. And PHP is still the fastest way to make a ‚Äúdynamic‚Äù website.\nI recently made a little invoice generator with a local browser interface for my freelance business. It works great! It‚Äôs got a homepage with a list of my generated invoices, a /new.php route for making a new one, and /invoices/generated/{invoice_id} routes to view each invoice in a printable format.\nI don‚Äôt find the boilerplate required to make a RESTful web service in NodeJS especially onerous‚ÄîI have a pretty good system for it at this point. But PHP brings the time-to-hello-world down tremendously. I just don‚Äôt think this would have gotten off the ground if I had to setup ExpressJS, copy my router boilerplate, make 2 files for each route (the template and the javascript that serves it), and do all the other things I do to structure web-apps in Node. Instead, I got all that stuff built-in with vanilla PHP, and that will presumably work for as long as PHP does. I didn‚Äôt even have to touch the package manager.\nA lot of people have the attitude that writing vanilla code (and vanilla PHP especially) is never okay because you need secure-by-default frameworks to ensure that you don‚Äôt make any security mistakes. It clearly true that if you are building professional software you should be aware of the web security model and make informed decisions about the security model of your application; not everyone is building professional software.\nRelatedly, one route to becoming is a software professional is to have a delightful experience as a software amateur.\nI believe that more people should use the internet not just as consumers, but as creators (not of content but of internet). There is a lot of creativity on the web that can be unlocked by making web development more accessible to artists, enthusiasts, hobbyists, and non-web developers of all types. The softer the learning curve of getting online, the more people will build, share, play, and create there.\nSoftening the learning curve means making the common things easy and not introducing too many concepts until you hit the point where you need them. Beginners and experts alike benefit.\nNotes\nThanks to Nathaniel Sabanski and Al Sweigart for their feedback on a draft of this blog. I wrote this blog at Recurse Center, a terrific programming community that you should check out.\n\nMy example invoice generator is not meant to be put online, so it doesn‚Äôt escape text to prevent XSS attacks, or do the other web security basics.\nAdmittedly, some of PHP‚Äôs design decisions really lend themselves to insecure code. For starters, they really need a short echo tag that auto-escapes.\nAt this time, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to start defaulting to PHP for client work. I‚Äôm very comfortable in JS for general-purpose dynamic programming, and JS has a bunch of other useful web built-ins that PHP does not.\nI am definitely going to do more web art in PHP, though. I especially like how compact and shareable it can be, which has tremendous value for certain types of code.\nPHP is also missing a bunch of stuff I consider really important to writing RESTFUL web services, that makes pre-processing your requests close to mandatory. Big ones for me include removing the .php file extension from the URL, and PUT/DELETE support.\nYes, I‚Äôm aware of well-known opinion-haver David Heinemeier Hansson‚Äôs other opinions. Some of them are right and some of them are wrong.\nMore languages should have a ‚Äúthing‚Äù that they are ‚Äúfor.‚Äù Maybe I‚Äôll write about how awk rekindled my love for programming next.\n\n","id":"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/best-hello-world-web-development/","title":"The Best \"Hello World\" in Web Development"},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/custom-html-has-levels/":{"body":"The comment I received most frequently on ‚ÄúBehavior Belongs in the HTML‚Äù was: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt Web Components solve this?‚Äù\n\nWeb Components aren‚Äôt an interface. They are‚Ä¶ well, a lot of things, including: the Shadow DOM, HTML templates, and a bunch of JavaScript APIs. But if what you mean is ‚Äúcustom elements,‚Äù then the answer is no. If you want to customize the behavior of an element, you shouldn‚Äôt have to wrap it in a new one.\nTo illustrate, I‚Äôm going to use the example that Chris Ferdinandi arrives at in ‚ÄúHTML Web Components.‚Äù He uses Web Components to make a form that, when it‚Äôs submitted, replaces the #item-list element with the response body, instead of navigating to a new page:\n&lt;ajax-form target=\"#item-list\"&gt;\n  &lt;form method=\"post\" action=\"/subscribe\"&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\"&gt;\n    &lt;button&gt;Subscribe&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;/ajax-form&gt;\n\nThis is great! Its declarative interface is easy to understand, and the form will work in the old, standard way if JavaScript is turned off (a concept called ‚Äúprogressive enhancement‚Äù). There‚Äôs just one problem with it: that wrapper element, &lt;ajax-form&gt;, is totally superfluous.\n&lt;form method=\"post\" action=\"/subscribe\" target=\"#item-list\"&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\"&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;Subscribe&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;form&gt;\n\nIn my version, I removed &lt;ajax-form&gt; and put the target attribute on the form itself. It has the same functionality and same fallback capability, but without any nesting (you‚Äôd want to use a slightly different name than ‚Äútarget,‚Äù but more on that later).\n\nIf all you need to do is augment the functionality of a single DOM node, custom attributes are a better interface for it, for a couple reasons:\n\nA flatter document is easier to read - I‚Äôm not saying you have to write all your HTML like this guy, but to the extent that you can flatten your document without loss of structure, you should.\nSurrounding with tags is a hassle - Yes, even with a good text editor, adding, editing and removing surrounding tags is annoying, compared to editing an attribute.\nIt‚Äôs closer to the default semantics - The markup (and DOM tree!) reflects that I‚Äôm slightly changing how the form works, not nesting the form inside a different form.\n\nAttributes are a demonstrably superior interface for customizing HTML elements‚Äîwhich is why when WHATWG adds behavior to existing elements, it does so by adding new attributes, not new tags to wrap them with. Using tag wrappers to alter the behavior of existing elements is a kludge, required only because HTML doesn‚Äôt properly support custom attributes. As Ferdinandi himself says: ‚Äúwhat I love about Web Components is that you can easily customize behavior with custom attributes.‚Äù You shouldn‚Äôt need Web Components for that.\nIncidentally, target in the above example is identical to htmx‚Äôs hx-target attribute, which also goes directly on the form.\n&lt;form hx-post=\"/subscribe\" hx-target=\"#item-list\"&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"email\" id=\"email\" name=\"email\"&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;Subscribe&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;form&gt;\n\nIn my time as an htmx maintainer, no one has ever asked ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I wrap the form with a new element instead?‚Äù\nCustom attributes fill the semantic deviation gap\nMy theory of custom attributes is that they are missing link between standard HTML and custom (web) components. They allow library authors to increase the capabilities of HTML, but in exchange for limiting those extensions to existing HTML elements, they get to borrow most of the existing elements‚Äô semantic power.\nI think of it in levels, where each number represents a jump in the amount you are deviating from HTML‚Äôs default semantics:\n\nUsing standard HTML\nUsing standard HTML elements with custom behavior\nUsing custom HTML elements\nUsing elements of some other framework that compiles down to HTML\n\nIdeally, you want to deviate as little as possible, because each successive level of semantic deviation represents a responsibility that you have inherited from the browser:\n\nThe browser understands everything\nThe browser knows what this element is, but not how it works\nThe browser knows neither what this element is nor how it works\nAll of the above, only now it's the framework's responsibility, not yours\n\nSo when you add a custom attribute to a form to change its behavior, your browser no longer controls that element‚Äôs functionality, but it still knows that it‚Äôs a form. That means you get all the built-in browser form features with no additional work, including autocomplete, screen reader functionality, and predictable refresh behavior‚Äîmuch better than if just made your own form-like component.\nThese features go to Level 2\nSometimes you really do need to go to Deviation Level 2, and create not just new behavior but a new thing. Here‚Äôs an example I adapted from Eric Meyer‚Äôs ‚ÄúBlinded by the Light DOM,‚Äù which I‚Äôm embedding directly inside my page because making your own web site is cool and I get to do that:\n\n  Title Font Size\n  \n\n\n  Unplanned Obsolescence\n\nThis is a &lt;font-slider&gt;. It‚Äôs a custom element that combines a &lt;label&gt; and a &lt;input type=range&gt; to make entirely new thing: a reset-able slider that controls font size. Take a moment to read the HTML interface for it.\n&lt;!--\nI'm deliberately not including any of the CSS or JS, because this blog\nis about HTML interfaces. See the link above or View Source for the rest.\n--&gt;\n&lt;font-slider unit=em target=\".preview span\"&gt;\n  &lt;label for=title-size&gt;Title font size&lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input id=title-size type=range min=0.5 max=4 step=0.1 value=2&gt;\n&lt;/font-slider&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=preview&gt;\n  &lt;span&gt;Unplanned Obsolescence&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nIn ‚ÄúBehavior Belongs in the HTML,‚Äù I emphasized how the attribute controls (unit, target, max) are easy to edit even if you don‚Äôt know how they‚Äôre implemented. Still true! But this time I want you to think about what the existence of &lt;font-slider&gt; adds to this markup. What new meaning it creates. What the HTML is saying to you.\nIt‚Äôs saying that the label and the input function together as a ‚Äúfont slider‚Äù‚Äîin which the value of the input will be used for the CSS on the page. That‚Äôs entirely different from what they mean when they‚Äôre together inside a &lt;form&gt; tag, where the value of that input will be used as a parameter in a network request.\n&lt;!-- This is just a labeled slider; it could control anything --&gt;\n&lt;label for=random-range&gt;Some slider&lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;input id=random-range type=range&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- This is a form slider; its value will be submitted to a server --&gt;\n&lt;form&gt;\n  &lt;label for=form-range&gt;Input value&lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input id=form-range type=range&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- This is a font slider; its value sets font sizes on the page --&gt;\n&lt;font-slider&gt;\n  &lt;label for=font-range&gt;Font size&lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;input id=font-range type=range&gt;\n&lt;/font-slider&gt;\n\nThe difference between &lt;font-slider&gt; and &lt;ajax-form&gt; is that the former establishes a new meaning for its subtree (this labeled input changes the font) and the latter retains the overall meaning of its subtree (the form still makes an HTTP request and displays the response to the user) while slightly modifying its behavior (this form will will display its response in the current page instead of a new one).\nYou can quibble about what degree of modification constitutes ‚Äúnew meaning‚Äù‚Äîthat‚Äôs language for ya‚Äîbut what matters is that there real tradeoffs at each deviation level. Library authors who only want to enhance existing elements (whatever that means to them) see this, and‚Äîcorrectly‚Äîdecide that their library will be easier to use if it is based in custom attributes rather than Web Components.\nAdding a new element is still more difficult than adding a new attribute, but in exchange for the extra syntax, we get increased power that suits the complexity of the task.\nFence the cowpaths\nThere are good reasons for using all of these levels, but only Deviation Level 1 lacks the appropriate support in legal HTML (data- attributes are insufficient, for reasons described by me here and better Joshua Wise here).\nWhen you talk about the need for better interfaces, you always get some comment along the lines of ‚Äúwell the thing you‚Äôre describing isn‚Äôt really that bad and people can just do it this other way.‚Äù That might be true. But if it‚Äôs worse than the alternative, people will use the alternative.\nA significant chunk of the web development community lives happily at Deviation Level 4; they understand HTML not as an authorship language, but as a compile target, and interact with HTML semantics only insofar as they are relevant for understanding the behavior of React, or Svelte, or LiveView. Staying in framework-land offers real ergonomic benefits for writing HTML-like markup, in addition to the actual reactive functionality that people ostensibly use the frameworks for.\n\nIf you think writing HTML directly should be encouraged (an argument for a future blog post), then it‚Äôs important that HTML‚Äôs ergonomics keep up with that of its competitors, where backwards compatibility and good sense permit.\nFortunately, there‚Äôs an extremely easy way to do this: save kebab-case attributes for custom behavior. This has excellent symmetry with kebab-case elements  already being reserved for users; instantly blesses multiple, significant JS libraries with valid markup; and encourages a field of HTML innovation whose utility is so self-evident that it has managed to develop in spite of official discouragement. As the OP, Lea Verou, wrote in 2017:\n\nThe more commonplace invalid HTML becomes, the less authors care about authoring valid HTML. Validation becomes pointless in their eyes if they see tons of perfectly good use cases being invalid.\n\nI won‚Äôt rehash the debate on that WHATWG issue here, but I want to emphasize one point in particular: making custom kebab-case attributes legal is something that can and should be decided on its own merits, independent of what JavaScript interface you build to interact with it. Verou recently put forward a proposal for an Attribute class that makes use of a lot of the same ideas as Web Components. That looks great‚Äîand hard. Hard to get right, hard to get consensus on, hard to get Google or Apple to commit to building. Reserving just the names, however, is a much smaller problem space, and can be done without convincing a billion-dollar company that it‚Äôs worth their time.\nThe best time to make ng-*, x-* and hx-* legal HTML was in 2017. The second best time is now.\nNotes\nThanks to Katrina Scialdone for reading a draft of this blog.\n\nCopying Eric Meyer‚Äôs &lt;super-slider&gt; (I changed it to &lt;font-slider&gt; to make the semantic point a little better) was eye-openingly easy. I just dumped the &lt;style&gt; and &lt;script&gt; tags from JS Fiddle he embedded and it worked perfectly. That‚Äôs the future‚Äîwe‚Äôre just working on the interface.\nWeb Components aren‚Äôt an interface‚Äînot one for users anyway‚Äîbut if you want to see what a good declarative interface for Web Components might look like, check out Katrina‚Äôs in-progress Facet library.\nSupposedly, Web Components are in use all over the place (probably because they‚Äôre so reliable to re-use and embed), but ‚Äúwriting custom HTML elements‚Äù is what ‚ÄúWeb Components‚Äù sounds like it should mean, and I expect that‚Äôs what a lot of people are thinking about when they ask why Web Components haven‚Äôt taken off.\nAt the risk of wading into the weird holy war around htmx‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs ironic that the libraries most committed to hypermedia‚Äîin both philosophy and practice‚Äîare the only ones writing invalid HTML. And it‚Äôs completely unnecessary.\nHappy New Year!\n\n\n\n\n","id":"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/custom-html-has-levels/","title":"Custom HTML Has Levels To It"},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/hard-page-load/":{"body":"While I‚Äôm not going to settle the Single-Page Web Application (SPA) debate in a blog post, there is\none claim about SPAs that routinely goes unchallenged, and it drives me nuts: that users prefer\nthem because of the ‚Äúmodern,‚Äù responsive feel.\n\nSPAs achieve their signature feel using partial page replacement: adding or removing DOM elements\ninstead of loading a new page. Partial page replacement is a very useful feature‚ÄîI‚Äôm working on an\nHTML standards proposal for it right now‚Äîbut SPAs typically\nuse them for everything, including page navigation, which causes a lot of problems.\nThe way this works is that rather than letting the browser load a new page when the user clicks an\n&lt;a&gt; tag, SPAs simulate page navigation by fetching with JavaScript, updating the page, and using\nthe History API to edit the browser‚Äôs URL bar. NextJS and React\nRouter work this way, as does SvelteKit. Even\nthe hypermedia libraries support this paradigm, with htmx‚Äôs\nhx-boost and Hotwire‚Äôs Turbo\nDrive.\nIn theory, avoiding ‚Äúhard‚Äù page navigations has the following benefits:\n\nThe app can make instant UI changes to reflect the user‚Äôs click, and fill in information from the\nnetwork request when it completes.\nThe whole page doesn‚Äôt repaint, i.e. the header and navigational links might remain in place while\nonly the middle of the page changes. This avoids the blank screen that users often see while\nwaiting for a new page to load.\nIt allows for fancier transitions between pages.\n\n\nThis discussion only applies to web applications that can be modeled with\npages, as opposed to something like Google Maps or RuneScape. But, web pages are a very flexible\nparadigm, and the chances that you're working on web content that cannot be modeled with pages are\nvery slim.\n\nWhat this does is essentially abstract away the concept of a link, and make the web page feel more\nlike an application on your phone. No longer are you navigating web pages, you‚Äôre moving around an\napp. I have a number of problems with this, but purely from a UX standpoint, it‚Äôs a massive\ndisservice to web users.\nManaging the network\nEvery day I ride the New York City Subway. For my carrier, most of the stops have cell service, and\nmost of the tunnels between stops do not. When I read web pages while riding, I am keenly aware\nthat if I click a link while I don‚Äôt have service, not only will the page fail to load, I will\nprobably also lose access to the one I‚Äôm currently reading. Everyone who uses a web browser\nunderstands this behavior on some level. So I avoid clicking links until I‚Äôm at a stop.\n\nI use the subway as an example to highlight that managing unreliable internet is a daily occurrence\neven in the most urban environments. Naturally, this concern is magnified in rural areas, which is\nwhy I'm deeply skeptical of the claim that SPAs somehow benefit people with slow or unstable\ninternet connections.\n\nOccasionally though, I‚Äôll mis-time it, and click a link right as the subway is pulling out of a\nstop: the page fails to load, and now I‚Äôm looking at a blank screen. In that situation, I much\nprefer to be on a traditional website than an SPA. On a website like Wikipedia, one that uses hard\nlinks and full page loads, then there‚Äôs a decent chance that the browser can save me: the back\nbutton will usually load the cached version of the page I was just on.\nIf it‚Äôs an SPA, however, in all likelihood clicking the back button will take me a different, mostly\nblank page, and now I‚Äôm just stuck. When the internet comes back, I‚Äôll refresh the page and\nhopefully land in the same place, but maybe not. In fact, my whole attitude towards a website\nchanges if it feels like an SPA. Subconsciously, I know that I have to baby it, and only use it in\nthe most optimal network conditions. The smoothness of a web application is an anti-indicator of its\nreliability and predictability as a web page.\nThat anti-indicator holds even in situations without unreliable internet. As a user, I‚Äôm always\nmuch happier when presented with a form that is entirely on one page, or has a ‚Äúhard‚Äù submit button\nfor each step that takes me to a new page, as opposed to a ‚Äúseamless‚Äù form that exists as a blob of\nJS state. The former has relatively predictable submit, autocomplete, and back button behavior,\nwhile the latter varies widely by implementation.\nMaybe you don‚Äôt ride the subway. But you‚Äôve probably driven on a highway with spotty service, or had\na bad Wi-Fi connection, or gotten on a plane, or been inside a basement with weirdly thick walls.\nEveryone has had to navigate the web under less-than-ideal network conditions, and you quickly\ndevelop an intuition for which websites will be resilient to them.\n\n\nThe web has seams, let them show\nDevelopers are naturally inclined to make their applications feel more responsive, and when they\ntest their SPA, it feels like a more natural experience than a clunky old web page. But this\ninstinct is usually incorrect, because most websites need to hit the network in response to user\nactions.\nWhen a user clicks a link, they want whatever information was at that link‚Äîwhich their device\nwill have to make a network trip to discover. When a user submits a form, they need to know whether\nor not that information was saved to the server, which their device will have to make a network trip\nto accomplish.\nI suppose there‚Äôs a version of the web that pre-fetches every possible page for you‚Äîand that might\nfeel pretty instantaneous. But there‚Äôs no world where that works for user-submitted data, because\nthe only thing I care about as a user is that the data actually got submitted. If I submit a form\nto a website, the website optimistically and instantaneously shows me that the submission\nsucceeded, and I later find out that it didn‚Äôt, I am mad.\n\nHave you ever refreshed a page to make sure that your information *really* got saved? Why did you\nfeel the need to double-check?\n\nThe friction involved with a hard page load doesn‚Äôt exist because web developers are too lazy to do\nperformance work‚Äîit reflects a real, physical limitation in the system that is beyond the ability of\none developer, and possibly humanity, to overcome. SPAs not only fail to remove the need for the\nnetwork call, they diminish the user‚Äôs ability to manage when that network call is made, and handle\nfailure cases.\nDiscussions of user agency in software are often very‚Ä¶ optimistic about how much users want to\nexercise that agency. But agency comes in many forms. When I was in 5th grade, I would load up\nGameFAQs guides for Final Fantasy\nIII on my iPod Touch before a road\ntrip, and in the car I‚Äôd make sure not navigate away from the page, or I‚Äôd lose the guide. When I\navoid clicking links between subways stops, I‚Äôm building on behavior I learned as a child, not as a\nsoftware engineer.\nIn the long run, the browser always wins\nI suspect that the primary impetus for this smoothness is commerce, or something I call\n‚Äúcasino-driven development.‚Äù As my Papou used to tell me, casinos do not have clocks because clocks\nremind you that time is passing; the casino would like you to forget that time is passing, because\nthey make more money the longer you remain in the casino. In the ad-based internet attention\neconomy, the website would like to keep you in their casino as long as possible-the less that\nyou‚Äôre reminded you‚Äôre on the web, where clicks usually require waiting, the better.\nInternet folklore has it that, in the 2000s, Amazon and Google research discovered that for each\nX additional millisecond of page load latency they lost Y customers and\ntherefore Z dollars. I can‚Äôt find any reliable sources for this, but the logic is\nsound. Some percentage of people will give up the longer it takes to see a result, and at that\nscale, that percentage translates into a lot of lost money.\nHere‚Äôs the problem: your team almost certainly doesn‚Äôt have what it takes to out-engineer the\nbrowser. The browser will continuously improve the experience of plain HTML, at no cost to you,\nusing a rendering engine that is orders of magnitude more efficient than JavaScript. To beat that,\nyou need to be continuously investing significant engineering effort into cutting-edge application\nwork.\nSome things you have to consider with SPAs:\n\nWhat happens when users refresh the page?\nWhat happens when users click the back button?\nWhat happens when users click the back button twice?\nWhat happens when users click the back button twice, the forward button once, and then the back\nbutton again?\nWhat happens when users try to open a link in a new tab?\nWhat happens when users users copy the link from the address bar and send it to a friend?\nWhere does the page focus go when it navigates?\n\nYou can engineer your way out of basically all the problems I‚Äôve described here, but it takes\nenormous effort. And maintenance on the pile of libraries required to get back basic browser\nfeatures like ‚Äúback button navigation‚Äù on your SPA is a new fixed cost, paid for with your\ntime. If you use hard page loads, those things not only\nwork for free, they work forever, and they work in exactly the way the user expects and desires.\n\nHard page loads also reset the JavaScript environment every time, drastically reducing the surface\narea for memory leaks.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the NextJS showcase lists Nike‚Äôs\nshopping platform as one of their successes. If you are literally Nike, and throwing millions at\nmaking your shopping portal slightly more responsive could result in tens of millions of revenue, by\nall means take a crack at it. I, personally, am dubious that the math typically pencils out, even\nfor Nike, but I concede that it‚Äôs at least plausible that you will deliver a networked experience\nthat is a hair quicker than what the default HTML can do, and reap the rewards.\n\nHere I'm going to be annoying and note that the Nike website is kinda slow.\n\nMeanwhile, the browser marches on, improving the UX of every website that uses basic HTML semantics.\nFor instance: browsers often don‚Äôt repaint full pages anymore. Try browsing\nWikipedia (or my blog) on a decent internet\nconnection and notice how rarely the common elements flash (this feature is called ‚Äúpaint holding‚Äù). And, if the connection isn‚Äôt fast, then the browser shows\na loading bar! It‚Äôs a win for users, and one of the many ways that sticking with the web primitives\nrewards developers over time.\nSo if you‚Äôre a bank, or a government, or pretty much anyone with engineering resources short of\n‚Äúlimitless,‚Äù you will likely be better served by sticking to hard page loads (and the default HTML\ncapabilities) as much as possible. It‚Äôs dramatically easier to implement and benefits from browser\nperformance and security improvements over time. For page responsiveness improvements, try tweaking\nyour cache headers, scrutinizing the JavaScript you send to the client, and optimizing your CDN\nsetup. It always pays off in the long run.\nBonus: A Good Use of SPAs\nWhen I worked at the Washington Post, I worked on the interactive map that they used for live\nelection night coverage. Watch my former boss, Jeremy Bowers, clicking around it the\nlivestream. Here‚Äôs me and\nDylan Freedman, in front of an early version:\n\n  \n  \n    I had to leave this project after like 6 weeks and Brittany\n    took my place. As you can see, it improved dramatically after I left.\n  \n\nThat‚Äôs a giant SvelteKit app! The map GUI is controlled by a Svelte\nstore, and, if I remember correctly, a websocket updates the\nvotes totals in the background. When you click on a US State, it shows a close-up of that\nstate and all the election info that had come in so far.\nThis is a great use of a reactive UI framework, because the data stored on the client doesn‚Äôt\nupdate in response to user actions, it updates in response to new election results. The clicking\nshould be instantaneous, and the UI should live entirely on the client, because they can!\nAnd it‚Äôs remarkable that you can compete with very expensive interactive map products using nothing\nbut a browser, open source libraries, and a couple months of engineer-time.\nI had so much fun learning Svelte for this that I used to as the basis for\nAYTA. If I were doing AYTA again though, I would definitely use\nhtmx.\nThanks to Mani Sundararajan for his feedback on a draft of this\npost; thanks to Deniz Ak≈üim≈üek for digging up the paint holding blog.\nNotes\n\nWhen is a good time to do partial page replacements? Either a) to add new information that would\nbe there after a refresh, because it reflects the current state of the resource, e.g. a\nlive-updating baseball score or b) as a result of actions that the user understands are ephemeral,\nand wouldn‚Äôt expect to see after a refresh, like a dialog box.\nI am generously assuming that the SPA psuedo-navigation actually does use &lt;a&gt; tags. For a while\nthat was not really incentivized by SPA frameworks, and people would just use &lt;div&gt;s for\neverything, but this has definitely gotten better lately.\nIronically, Triptych has to simulate full-page\nnavigations with partial page replacements and the history API, exactly the same way that hx-boost\ndoes, and is subject to the same inherent bugginess and lack of isolation. This is a limitation of\nthe tools available in userland, and a big reason why these proposals should be supported\nnatively, rather than in a library.\nEarlier, I said that actions that do require a round-trip to server should just use one, but the\ninverse applies as well: ideally, actions that do not required a round-trip to the server wouldn‚Äôt\nuse one. A good example of this is form validation. In the htmx world, sometimes returning a new\nform with inline validation errors is ‚Äúgood enough,‚Äù\n(you always have to validate on the server, after all) but that experience can clearly be improved\nby having the validation occur without a network request. I usually wouldn‚Äôt use an SPA just for\nclient-side validation, but we can acknowledge that they are better at it right now.\nFurther reading:\n\n‚ÄúA Response To ‚ÄòHave Single-Page Apps Ruined the Web?‚Äô‚Äù, Carson Gross\n‚ÄúThe Market For Lemons‚Äù, Alex Russell\n\n\n\n","id":"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/hard-page-load/","title":"Who's Afraid of a Hard Page Load?"},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/less-htmx-is-more/":{"body":"It‚Äôs been two years since I wrote my first production webservice with htmx.\nTwo years is not a very long time, but early indicators suggest that the software projects I‚Äôve written with htmx are a much better experience for users, and orders of magnitude easier to maintain, than the software projects they replaced.\nThey are likely to remain useful for longer than anything else I‚Äôve ever written (so far).\nPretty good!\nLike any new tool, especially a tool that got popular as quickly as htmx, there are differing schools of thought on how best to use it.\nMy approach‚Äîwhich I believe necessary to achieve the results described above‚Äîrequires you to internalize something that htmx certainly hints at, but doesn‚Äôt enforce: use plain HTML wherever possible.\n\nOnce you get the hang of it, htmx starts pushing you in this direction anyway, and you start reaching for htmx less and less.\nIt requires a mindset shift though, especially if you‚Äôre not accustomed to building page behavior with HTML features.\nHow should we use htmx?\nIn my opinion, most websites should be using htmx for either:\n\nUpdates that users would not expect to see on a refresh (or a new page load)\nUpdates that would also be present on a refresh (or a new page load)\n\nEverything else should use regular links and regular forms that do standard, full-page navigations.\n\nYou also currently need htmx (or an equivalent library) to enable support for PUT and DELETE on regular forms.\nMore in that in the notes section.\n\nLet‚Äôs say you‚Äôre making a website that shows today‚Äôs baseball games, and you want it to update the stats live.\nHere‚Äôs how I would approach that.\nThe website‚Äôs home page should have all the currently-playing games on it, showing the live score for each one.\nEach of those live scoreboards uses htmx to poll the server at regular intervals for updates.\nClicking on the scoreboard title (which is a regular &lt;a&gt; link) takes you to that game‚Äôs page, at its own URL.\nThe game page has not just the score, but the pitch count, the game‚Äôs full box score, and so on;\nthese update with htmx as well.\nThe idea here is that the website still has a sound URL structure, which is managed by the core browser functionality, while interactivity is carefully layered on top, with targeted updates.\nExactly what merits a targeted update versus a new page depends on what you‚Äôre building, but you should have a mental model that distinguishes between them in some capacity.\n\nUsing htmx to enable specific, isolated functionality‚Äîrather than letting it drive the overall experience‚Äîis arguably using it like a library, instead of a framework.\n\nUnfortunately, a lot of the beginner guides suggest that you can get started easily by ‚Äúupgrading‚Äù all your links with hx-boost.\nI disagree with this.\nWhile htmx is amazing for targeted page updates, I highly discourage using it to take over all page navigation.\nWhat is hx-boost?\nhx-boost is an attribute that converts a ‚Äúregular‚Äù link into a ‚Äúboosted‚Äù link:\n&lt;!-- normal link --&gt;\n&lt;a href=example.com&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- boosted link --&gt;\n&lt;a href=example.com hx-boost=true&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;\n\nInstead of doing a full page navigation when the ‚Äúboosted‚Äù link is clicked, htmx will issue an HTTP request to the link‚Äôs URL and replace the &lt;body&gt; of the page with the content of the response.\nIn theory, this feels ‚Äúsmoother‚Äù because it only repaints part of the page, mimicking the feel of a Single-Page Application (SPA).\nWhat‚Äôs wrong with hx-boost?\nThe problems it solves are better solved by other means, and it creates a lot of problems on its own.\nUse hx-boost long enough, and something will go wrong.\nYou‚Äôll click the back button and see only a partial page update;\nyou‚Äôll refresh the page and it‚Äôll go blank;\nanother library that you‚Äôre using will conk out;\nelements will enter or exit the DOM in a way that you did not expect.\nFrom a coding perspective, this is not anyone‚Äôs fault‚Äîthe features promised by hx-boost are impossible.\nhx-boost uses the JavaScript History API, which exists to let single-page apps (SPAs) hook into session management functionality, most notably the browser‚Äôs forward and back buttons.\nIn practice, this is virtually impossible to get right, and is so annoying to implement that htmx creator Carson Gross made a meme about it.\nThe core problem is that with normal page navigation, each link you click resets the JavaScript environment and triggers a full set of page lifecycle events.\nThis is a very good thing.\nIt means that every additional script you include on the page has a standardized way to keep track of what‚Äôs happening.\nIf you replace this process with an ad-hoc, scripting-based navigation, you remove access to that common language for every other library on your page.\nYou also initiate a long-lived JavaScript environment that is likely to eventually enter a bad state of some kind.\nThis problem is inherent to SPAs, and it can only be resolved by not writing SPAs.\nSo don‚Äôt use the attribute that turns your htmx site into an SPA.\nWhat should I do instead?\nUse regular links. hx-boost promises to enhance the experience of a regular link; skip the middleman and just use them.\nRegular links are a better user experience and developer experience, full stop.\nWhat about the benefits of hx-boost?\nThe first time you use hx-boost, it feels magical to have the page update ‚Äúseamlessly‚Äù like that, but you can achieve all the same benefits, without the headaches, using browser features.\nSend cache headers to re-use CSS and JS across page loads\nBasically all static file servers support ETags.\nWhen the server sends the browser a file, it can also send a unique string that identifies that version of the file.\nThe next time you try to load that file (after, for instance, navigating to a new page that uses the same CSS), the browser asks your server, ‚Äúis it still this one?‚Äù, and sends that ETag string.\nIf the file hasn‚Äôt changed, the server just responds with a 304 Not Modified header and the browser users its cached version.\nIn most cases, this is process adds essentially nothing to your load times.\nThe browser has to talk to the server anyway to get whatever info is on the next page, and it‚Äôs re-using the same TCP connection to do so.\nThe GET -&gt; 304 back-and-forth is a handful of extra bytes on an already-open socket.\nBut if you don‚Äôt want the browser to even ask, you can do that do by setting a cache control header.\nHere‚Äôs how I load htmx in all the websites where I use it.\nWe‚Äôll use version 1.9.3 as an example.\nI include a script tag like this in the header:\n&lt;script src=\"/htmx-1.9.3.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\nWhen the user loads the page for the very first time, their browser sends the HTTP request GET /htmx-1.9.3.js to my server.\nThe server will send back something like this in response:\nHTTP/2 200\naccept-ranges: bytes\ncache-control: public, max-age=31536000\nlast-modified: Fri, 06 Sep 2024 22:09:43 GMT\netag: W/\"24b79-191c962d458\"\ncontent-type: application/javascript; charset=UTF-8\n\nThat says: ‚Äúdownload htmx 1.9.3 from my server exactly once, and then never ask me for it again for a full calendar year.‚Äù\nFrom that point on, for one year, every time that browser loads a page at the same domain that includes htmx 1.9.3, the browser won‚Äôt even ask the server for it, it‚Äôll just use the saved version.\nIf I want to upgrade everyone to a new version, I just change the version number in the URL:\n&lt;!-- From this... --&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"/htmx-1.9.3.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- ...to this --&gt;\n&lt;script src=\"/htmx-1.9.4.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n\nThe next time each of my users loads that page, their browsers will see that the page requires a new file it doesn‚Äôt have, and ask for the server for it again.\nIf I don‚Äôt even want to include a version number‚Äîmaybe for a file like stylesheet.css‚ÄîI can use a URL query.\n&lt;!-- The browser will consider these two different files,\n      but your server will know that they're the same --&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/stylesheet.css\"&gt;\n&lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/stylesheet.css?id=1\"&gt;\n\nAgain, basically every static file server supports this pattern.\nUse same-origin links to get partial page updates\nThis website (unplannedobsolescence.com) uses exclusively regular links, and if you click around up top you‚Äôll see that the header largely stays in place.\nThis happens automatically now, for same-origin links to pages with the same structure and stylesheets (like I showed you above).\nHere‚Äôs the Chrome team announcing this feature:\n\nTry Paint Holding in Chrome Canary (Chrome 76) and let us know what you think. Developers shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about making any modifications to their pages to take advantage of it.\n\nChrome 76 came out four years ago, in 2019.\nEveryone who built their website with regular links got a significant, free performance upgrade to their website pushed out to billions of people;\nthe same is not true for everyone who tried to replace that functionality with JavaScript.\nLeverage HTML for free performance upgrades\nUsing standard HTML features allows the browser to optimize performance and UX in ways that JavaScript is categorically incapable of.\nEvery time the browser updates it is getting better at loading, parsing, and rendering webpages.\nPage history, loading bars, the back button, the cancel button, the URL bar, etc., all work correctly, by default, every time, on every browser.\nIn the long run, the browser always wins.\nWhy does hx-boost exist then?\nhtmx was created during a period in which it seemed like SPAs were the inevitable future of web development.\nTo compete in that environment, it had to demonstrate that it could replicate what most people considered to be the killer feature of SPAs: not repainting the whole page.\nIf this was ever necessary‚ÄîI‚Äôm skeptical‚Äîit‚Äôs sure not necessary anymore.\nNow that htmx has proven itself in the mindshare ecosystem, and developers are starting to trust multi-page websites again, I think the time has come to make the harder, but ultimately more impactful case: HTML and HTTP have the features required to build the vast, vast majority of website functionality; they‚Äôre easier to use than the scripting alternatives, and they last longer with much less maintenance.\n\nUsers always trusted multi-page websites, by the way.\nWe're just now starting to listen to them again.\n\nBuilding good websites requires dropping the sugar high of hx-boost and saying ‚Äúhere‚Äôs how to use a cache header.‚Äù\nIs there ever a time I should use htmx to make an SPA?\nMy friend Aram made a website called Song Obsessed that has a persistent music player which holds its state even as you navigate around the site.\nhx-boost is a good fit for this because it allows you to construct your website as a series of URLs; you can just slap hx-boost on everything and, with a little tweaking, you can get htmx to leave the music player alone while replacing the rest of the page.\nYou still lost the reliability inherent in the hard page load, but you get genuinely novel functionality in exchange, which is a good trade in this case.\nUntil HTML has an API to keep live content persistent across page navigations, some SPA functionality is required to make that happen.\nSPAs are an advanced tool that the industry deceptively marketed as a simple one.\nAram is a highly experienced web developer who‚Äôs using hx-boost to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible with page navigations;\nMost people, who just want to add a little interactivity to their webpage, should stick with the simplest tool available: a regular link.\nThanks to Carson Gross his for feedback on a draft of this article. Comments available on lobste.rs\nNotes\n\nTriptych‚Äîthe HTML proposals that Carson and I are working on‚Äîwould render htmx obsolete for the type of website I describe here.\nMore advanced htmx features, like the ones used to great effect by David Guillot and Contexte, will still require htmx for the foreseeable future.\nTo add PUT (and DELETE) support to ‚Äúregular‚Äù forms with htmx, add hx-put to the form, and then have the server respond with status code 200 and an HX-Redirect header;\ninstead of doing partial page replacement, htmx will tell the browser to do a full-page navigation.\nThis mimics the POST-Redirect-GET pattern, but uses a header instead of a 303 response.\nIdeally, htmx would be able to intercept a normal 303 response and use the location header, instead of a custom header, but because of limitations in the fetch API (manual redirects hide all the headers), it can‚Äôt.\nI don‚Äôt totally understand what security purpose this serves, to be honest, but it‚Äôs a bit of a shame, because it means that you can‚Äôt make a proper polyfill for PUT and DELETE forms.\nBoth turbo and datastar use Carson‚Äôs idiomorph algorithm to merge updates into the page, but Carson ended up rejecting idiomorph as the default merging algorithm for htmx, because it was too complicated‚Äîeven though he‚Äôs the one who created it in the first place!\nThe default htmx swap strategy is to just wipe away what‚Äôs inside the innerHTML and replace it with the response‚Äînot unlike how the default page navigation is to wipe away the environment and give you a fresh one.\nSimple; effective.\n\n","id":"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/less-htmx-is-more/","title":"Less htmx is More"},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/messy-pile-css/":{"body":"A couple months ago I was sitting next to Ivy Wong and I saw them working on a dropdown menu so cute that I immediately asked how they did it.\n\nIt looked something like this:\n\n\n  Home\n  New\n  Pages\n  Logout\n\nI call this the Messy Pile, and I think it‚Äôs brilliant. It has lots of personality without breaking\nthe basic utility and structure of a menu list.\nInternally, it feels haphazard; externally, it takes up a very normal box shape on the page, which\neasily fits in both desktop and mobile views.\n\n  Home\n  New\n  Pages\n  Logout\n\nLet‚Äôs make it together. We‚Äôll start with just a regular list of items:\n&lt;ul class=messy-pile&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Home\n  &lt;li&gt;New\n  &lt;li&gt;Pages\n  &lt;li&gt;Logout\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\n  Home\n  New\n  Pages\n  Logout\n\nAnd then add some CSS to make them orderly boxes:\n&lt;style&gt;\n.messy-pile {\n  list-style-type: none;\n  margin: 0 auto;\n  padding: 0;\n  width: fit-content;\n}\n\n.messy-pile li {\n  background-color: bisque;\n  border: 2px black solid;\n  margin: 5px 0;\n  text-align: center;\n  width: 200px;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n\n\n  Home\n  New\n  Pages\n  Logout\n\nAnd finally, we rotate the boxes, one degree clockwise for the odd-numbered items, and counterclockwise for the even-numbered ones:\n.messy-pile li:nth-child(odd) {\n  transform: rotate(1deg);\n}\n\n.messy-pile li:nth-child(even) {\n  transform: rotate(-1deg);\n}\n\nAnd you get these cute tilted boxes!\n\n  Home\n  New\n  Pages\n  Logout\n\nBetter CSS Leads to Better HTML\nIvy‚Äôs dense yet simple implementation of this pattern highlights something that took me a long time to learn: it‚Äôs only possible to write good HTML if you write good CSS.\nIf you showed someone this design and asked them to implement it, it‚Äôs easy to imagine an implementation that looks like this:\n&lt;div class=messy-pile-container&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"messy-pile-item left\"&gt;Home&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"messy-pile-item right\"&gt;New&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"messy-pile-item left\"&gt;Pages&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"messy-pile-item right\"&gt;Logout&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- the common styling is omitted for brevity --&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;\n.messy-pile-item.left { transform: rotate(1deg); }\n.messy-pile-item.right { transform: rotate(-1deg); }\n&lt;/style&gt;\n\nI could definitely have written that depending on when in my career you asked me to do it.\nSo what‚Äôs better about this one?\n&lt;ul class=messy-pile&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Home\n  &lt;li&gt;New\n  &lt;li&gt;Pages\n  &lt;li&gt;Logout\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- the common styling is omitted for brevity --&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;\n.messy-pile li:nth-child(odd) { transform: rotate(1deg); }\n.messy-pile li:nth-child(even) { transform: rotate(-1deg); }\n&lt;/style&gt;\n\nAn obvious reason is that using the CSS :nth-child() pseudo-class (along with its odd and even keyword values) ensures that the pattern will automatically apply to an arbitrary number of items, as opposed to manually switching between  left and right classes.\nAdd new items, or move existing ones, and they‚Äôll all stay perfectly arranged, without touching the CSS.\n\n  Home\n  New\n  Friends\n  Pages\n  Explore\n  Logout\n\nA subtler reason is that writing better CSS lets us move redundant information out of the HTML, dramatically simplifying it.\nIn doing so, we take advantage of both CSS features and HTML semantics.\n&lt;ul class=messy-pile&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Home\n  &lt;li&gt;New\n  &lt;li&gt;Pages\n  &lt;li&gt;Logout\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\nThis is the only HTML in our example.\nYou‚Äôll notice that it‚Äôs just a regular unordered list.\nIts purpose is immediately clear and it‚Äôs not visually dense in the slightest.\nThe only concession we‚Äôve made to the styling is a single class, messy-pile.\nThe list semantics give us a natural way to style this component,\nLists pretty much only have &lt;li&gt; children, so we can style the list itself with .messy-pile and the items with .messy-pile li.\nThere‚Äôs very little we have to add to the HTML to make this work.\nHTML semantics are often discussed in the context of making it easier for user agents (browsers, accessibility tech, etc.) to understand what your web page is trying to accomplish‚Äîbut they also make it easier for you (and future readers of your code) to understand what your web page is trying to accomplish.\nHere‚Äôs the other sample implementation from before; it does the same thing but with most of the HTML semantics removed.\n&lt;div class=messy-pile-container&gt;\n  &lt;div class=messy-pile-item&gt;Home&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=messy-pile-item&gt;New&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=messy-pile-item&gt;Pages&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=messy-pile-item&gt;Logout&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nThis is much worse.\nWe have to add classes to both the container and the list item, since &lt;div&gt; is a generic element that could contain lots of things, including other &lt;div&gt;s.\nThe additional visual weight takes more time to read, feels bad to look at, and has none of the same accessibility properties.\nThis example is trivial‚Äîthe version with the divs is still very intelligible‚Äîbut as you start to layer on additional concepts, it gets out of hand quickly. For instance, the items in this example are mean to be a menu bar, so they all have to be links. With a list, that‚Äôs still pretty easy to read:\n&lt;!-- With a list --&gt;\n&lt;ul class=messy-pile&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=/home&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=/new&gt;New&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=/pages&gt;Pages&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=/logout&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\nDefinitely busier, but still easy to follow.\nHow does it look with divs?\n&lt;!-- With divs --&gt;\n&lt;div class=messy-pile-container&gt;\n  &lt;div class=messy-pile-item&gt;\n    &lt;a href=/home&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=messy-pile-item&gt;\n    &lt;a href=/new&gt;New&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=messy-pile-item&gt;\n    &lt;a href=/new&gt;Pages&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=messy-pile-item&gt;\n    &lt;a href=/logout&gt;Logout&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nOh. It‚Äôs starting to become XML (derogatory).\nI‚Äôm being a little cheeky here by omitting the closing tags for &lt;li&gt; elements to keep the &lt;a&gt; tags on the same line, while not doing the same for the &lt;div&gt;s.\nBut that‚Äôs also my point!\n&lt;li&gt; tags can be closed automatically, &lt;div&gt; tags can‚Äôt.\nKnowing HTML semantics lets you express your ideas more concisely, which in turn gives you more room to layer on new ideas before you start to feel the pressure to refactor.\nMeanwhile, the div version looks and feels like a compile target‚Äîwhich is exactly why lots of people treat it as one.\nWhen your HTML is lots of divs and classes, then higher level abstractions like React Components are necessary to make the code you‚Äôre writing intelligible again.\nMany people start from the assumptions that these abstractions are necessary because they‚Äôve only ever seen code that‚Äôs painful to write without them.\nBut Does It Scale?\nThe reason we adopt additional abstractions on top of HTML semantics is because eventually the thing we‚Äôre trying to describe gets more complicated.\nIt happens even with the most beautifully-written HTML.\nReality‚Äîor at least the little piece of the reality that we‚Äôre trying to make easier with software‚Äîis complicated.\nSo if you‚Äôre reading this and thinking, ‚Äúsure, but what I‚Äôm doing could never be done with plain HTML and CSS,‚Äù I humbly suggest that you give it a try.\nYou won‚Äôt know what HTML and CSS can and can‚Äôt accomplish until you actually try to push their limits for your use-case, forcing yourself to find those native features.\nI, personally, have found that they go a lot farther than I previously thought.\nComplex page layouts are going to require compromises‚Äîthe trick is to use the tools available to you to push those compromises as far out as possible.\nThe better you know your tools, the farther you can get before you have to fashion new ones, and the simpler the abstractions you develop are going to be.\nThis blog is about an interaction that Ivy and I had at the Recurse Center. If you love programming and are interested in expanding your horizons, you should check it out.\nNotes\n\nIf the unclosed &lt;li&gt; tags bother you, check out Aaron Parks‚Äô Write HTML Right.\nYou may or may not want to write all your HTML that way, but it will hopefully break you out of the idea that HTML should look like XML. Markdown doesn‚Äôt make you close bullets, why should HTML?\nBEM is one popular methodology (among many) for scaling up CSS.\nIf your project and org chart are operating at a scale that BEM helps with, by all means use it, but I am personally of the opinion that strict conventions tend to age poorly as the language naturally develops internal mechanisms to deal with the problems that the conventions were originally built to solve‚Äîthat‚Äôs basically the argument of this whole blog.\nAlso, &lt;button class=\"button\"&gt; makes me want to die. That simply can‚Äôt be the best way to write CSS.\nSpeaking of scaling: keep in mind that scaling developers is not a business requirement; scaling your ability to improve the website is.\nIf you make it easier for a couple developers to manage all the frontend tasks, you don‚Äôt need to be siloing them so much.\nThis is true both ‚Äúvertically‚Äù (frontend vs backend), and horizontally (different teams working on different parts of the same page).\nOn the other end of the spectrum is the CSS Zen Garden, which demonstrates how the same HTML can be used to create dramatically different-looking layouts, just by swapping out the stylesheet.\nYou certainly don‚Äôt need your website to be ready for arbitrary stylesheets‚Äîand I‚Äôm not skilled enough with CSS to pull that off anyway‚Äîbut you should shoot for a website with sufficiently sane HTML structure that it would easy enough to follow if it had no styling.\nI used a modified Messy Pile for the &lt;aside&gt;s in my last blog post You have to be on desktop with a wide enough window to see it applied.\n\n","id":"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/messy-pile-css/","title":"The Messy Pile"},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/mostly-true-naming-rule/":{"body":"Naming things properly is very hard to do, so, as programmers, we come up with little rules to help us.\nThese rules are often inconsistent.\n\n\nVariables should be snake case (e.g. last_name) in Python but camel case (e.g. lastName) in JavaScript\nNames should be snake case in Python, except classes and exceptions, which are camel case\nConstants should be all caps in Java but not Scala\n\nAnd these are all relatively similar programming languages.\nNaming conventions start to diverge wildly when you start talking about languages like SQL, HTML, or COBOL.\nReasonable people understand that these rules are more what you‚Äôd call guidelines, and that being consistent in your conventions is generally the most important thing.\nI do have a naming rule that I like, though, one which is mostly applicable everywhere.\n\nDo not give multiple names to the same thing.\n\nLike all rules, it often comes into conflict with other rules, but I find this one usually wins.\nCase Study: Outdoor Trips\nI have a production application that manages a college‚Äôs outdoor trips program.\nIt has an SQL table that catalogs the gear that students going on the trip have requested to borrow (backpacks, headlamps, things of that nature);\nthis table is called member_gear_requests.\nI named it this because there is also a table called trip_members that holds the students going on a particular trip.\nTrip members request gear, therefore, member_gear_requests.\nSimple enough.\nAt some point while building the application, I decided that the term ‚Äúmember gear‚Äù sounded kind of weird.\nTrips have two types of gear: gear that everyone shares (like a tent) and gear that belongs to each person (like a backpack).\nIn the frontend, I called the two lists ‚ÄúGroup Gear‚Äù and ‚ÄúIndividual Gear‚Äù.\nYou might be wondering: how does ‚Äúmember gear,‚Äù as it‚Äôs called in the database, become ‚Äúindividual gear‚Äù, as it‚Äôs called in the frontend?\nI‚Äôve never tried to answer this, so let‚Äôs take a look together, going backwards from the HTML template.\n&lt;h3&gt;Individual Gear&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;table class=\"gear\"&gt;\n  {% for item in member_requested_gear %}\n  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;{{ item.name }}&lt;td&gt;{{ item.quantity }}\n  {% endfor %}\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\nOkay well that‚Äôs not so bad.\nThere‚Äôs an &lt;h3&gt; header that says ‚ÄúIndividual Gear‚Äù and then a template variable called member_requested_gear.\nPerhaps the entire application refers to this concept as ‚Äúmember gear,‚Äù and then just puts an ‚ÄúIndividual Gear‚Äù header on top of it.\nNot ideal, but certainly reasonable.\nWhere does the data for that line come from?\ntrip.member_requested_gear = memberRequestedGear\n\nOh, uh, sure.\nI guess I wanted to maintain JavaScript and HTML casing conventions (JS is camel case, HTML is‚Ä¶ more complicated).\nWhere does memberRequestedGear get set?\nconst memberRequestedGear = gear.getIndividualRequestedGear(req.db, tripId)\n\nOh God no.\n‚ÄúIndividual Gear‚Äù again?\nYou mean it switches back and forth?\nAnd, of course, that function makes an SQL query to a table called‚Ä¶ member_gear_requests.\nexport function getIndividualRequestedGear(db, tripId) {\n  // Some SQL query here, to the effect of:\n  // SELECT ...\n  // FROM member_gear_requests\n}\n\nIn summary, here are all the names I gave to the concept of ‚Äúgear that trip participants requested for their personal use‚Äù:\n\nIndividual Gear\nmember_requested_gear\nmemberRequestedGear\n(get)IndividualRequestedGear\nmember_gear_requests\n\nThat turned out to be an even stupider example than I expected (I wrote 100% of that code myself, by the way).\nSome of these are necessary.\nThe frontend is supposed to be a friendlier representation of the data than the code; we‚Äôre not going to use snake case for the &lt;h3&gt;.\nBut if I had named the table correctly and didn‚Äôt bother with camel case variable names, we could easily have had the following:\n\nIndividual Gear (in the frontend)\ngetIndividualGearRequests (as a function)\nindividual_gear_requests (in the database and all variable names)\n\n\nA braver person than me would also tell you to use snake case for the function as well.\nI think functions and variables are different enough, conceptually, that it doesn't matter.\nBut feel free!\n\nWhy Names Matter\nUnix tools have this idea that text is the universal interface between programs.\ngrep, awk, find, xargs, and so on are all built to talk to each other via text.\nCode works the same way, and the philosophy originates from the same place‚Äîgrep, for instance, originated as a command in the text editor ed.\nThe longer that I‚Äôve been doing this, the more I‚Äôve come to rely on text search as my primary method for navigating codebases.\nThat‚Äôs because it‚Äôs always available‚Äîthe program will always described in text.\nIf I‚Äôm fast at finding things with search, I can navigate anything without much onboarding, even if I‚Äôm unfamiliar with the programming language or paradigm.\nWhen I‚Äôm going to be working in a programming language long enough, I usually set up an LSP integration, so I can go-to-definition and things like that.\nBut even when I have the LSP set up, there are always cases that it simply can‚Äôt handle, or that require increasingly complex configurations.\nDoes the LSP know about the database schema?\nThe templating language?\nHow all these things connect?\n\nThere only language where I would remotely believe that is Java.\nBut even then‚Äîit's kinda finnicky!\nIntelliJ is usually a sea of red on moderately-complex codebases until I figure out which three settings to toggle.\n\nNunjucks, the templating engine in this case study, does not have any LSP integrations that I‚Äôm aware of (nor does it need one).\nSo if a brand new contributor is trying to figure out how the ‚ÄúIndividual Gear‚Äù list is created, they‚Äôre gonna have a much easier time if the fuzzy search for ‚Äúindividualgear‚Äù turns up a clear cross-section of that idea‚Äîfrom the database schema, to the backend logic, to the HTML template.\nMuch better than sending them on a breadcrumb goose chase through my disjointed thought process.\n\nMultiple students (presumably learning React-based web development) have contributed to this project with basically no onboarding help.\n\nClear ideas beget clear names.\nIf you‚Äôre having trouble keeping consistent, it‚Äôs a sign that you need to take a second to think through your plans.\nTips for staying consistent\nCodebases, like the rings on a tree, reflect the varying conditions that produced them over time.\nFor this application:\n\nI was re-writing an existing MongoDB + ReactJS app to SQLite + htmx\nThis was my first time doing #1 and I was learning patterns for it as I progressed\n\nIn general, it‚Äôs important to have grace for the process by which a codebase grows, which necessarily leaves behind knots and scars as indicators of progress.\nSo here‚Äôs a couple of the knots.\nIf you change it once, change it everywhere\nOne lesson from this case study is to not randomly switch between ‚Äúindividual‚Äù and ‚Äúmember,‚Äù\nThat happened because I wanted to change what the thing was called, but didn‚Äôt feel like doing the migrations and grepping required to do it properly.\nIt‚Äôs reasonable to change the name, it‚Äôs reasonable not to change the name‚Äîbut pick one.\nOtherwise: squish like grape.\n(Once again, this doesn‚Äôt apply to anything that users see, which often doesn‚Äôt match up perfectly with what‚Äôs in the database)\nMany codebases experience semantic drift over time, as multiple people with different ideas work on it and new requirements get added.\nBut in my case that was just a huge unforced error.\nYou have permission to laugh at me for up to 20 seconds.\nIf you use SQL, adopt snake case variables\nSQL has the annoying limitation that if you want upper-case letters in your table or column names, you have to quote them:\n-- Classic SQL\nSELECT first_name, last_name\nFROM users\nWHERE first_name like 'Alex%';\n\n-- These columns you have quote with double quotes.\n-- Unlike string literals, which are single quotes!\nSELECT \"firstName\", \"lastName\"\nFROM users\nWHERE \"firstName\" like 'Alex%';\n\nThe quoting rules are slightly different depending on the implementation, which is also irritating.\nThe point is: stick to snake case names, and you‚Äôre fine.\nWith that constraint in place, we then have to use the values in our application.\nAt first, it feels natural to translate the snake case SQL column name into something that matches your programming language‚Äôs casing convention.\nIf you can at all avoid it, don‚Äôt.\nCalling something first_name in the database but firstName in the application code is just not worth it.\nChanging case provides an unnecessary surface for inconspicuous bugs, and makes it meaningfully harder to search your codebase for all the usages of a particular concept.\nIt accomplishes nothing besides scratching your own itch for ‚Äúcleanliness.‚Äù\nAs much as possible, first_name should always be first_name.\nMany ORMs (the libraries that translate database queries into application logic) will perform a casing translation for you (see: Hibernate, Sequelize).\nThis, too, is an opportunity for strange bugs, in which queries fail because the casing translation doesn‚Äôt work the way you, or the ORM, expected.\nIt‚Äôs an obvious error once you see it, but reading through strange, auto-generated SQL (if the stack trace even includes that by default) is a chore.\nI picked Hibernate and Sequelize as examples because I got hit with this exact problem in both of those ORMs.\nIf you‚Äôre planning to basically never write SQL and you trust the ORM‚Äôs magic renaming (not my style, but to each their own), or you are using a database that doesn‚Äôt have this constraint, then this note doesn‚Äôt apply to you.\nThat‚Äôs fine too.\nFollow naming conventions where you can; jettison them when they require you to rename something for no reason other than convention.\nDon‚Äôt abbreviate\nThis one doesn‚Äôt really come up in the case study but it‚Äôs helpful and relevant: resist the temptation to abbreviate.\nIf it‚Äôs called start_time in one place, don‚Äôt assign it to start somewhere else.\nAgain, just not worth it.\nYou‚Äôre only going to type that code once, but you will likely search the codebase for start_time more than once, and you do not want to have to worry about alternative names, spellings, or abbreviations.\nOver the lifetime of an application, especially one that might change hands, that matters.\nJava is the language that most tempts you to come up with abbreviated names for things, because the Kingdom of Nouns is vast indeed.\nJava also has such great tooling that it‚Äôs easy to tell yourself that code inspection will never fail to find the thing you‚Äôre looking for.\nWrite the whole thing out and your future self will thank you while typing CMD+SHIFT+F into IntelliJ.\nNotes\nThanks to Morry Kolman and Katrina Scialdone for reading a draft of this blog.\n\nSoftware Engineering is an almost entirely abstract practice, so it‚Äôs not always obvious whether two concepts constitute the same concept‚Äîthey‚Äôre all just concepts someone made up.\nProperly unplacking that requires layers of philosophy that I, unfortunately, do not have ready to go.\nI think Plato is probably the right place to start?\nI recently had a situation where my database conventions lost to a more important constraint.\nIn SQL databases I like to give all primary keys unique names (i.e. users.user_id instead of users.id), since that lets you take advantage of the USING syntax.\nIn an ActivityPub application I‚Äôm working on, this rule lost to the naming rule, because ActivityPub uses id as an identifier for every possible type of object.\nI figured that out a little late and did go through the effort to write the migration; this turned out to be the right call.\nIn a different project, I used go and templ, because I met Adrian at Big Sky Dev Con (he‚Äôs very nice).\nTempl has very good LSP support, which I took the time to set up.\nHowever, going to templ definitions took me to templ‚Äôs auto-generated source code, not the code I was looking to modify.\nIrritating!\nI never bothered to figure out if that could be fixed because searching for usages by text was basically as fast.\n\n","id":"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/mostly-true-naming-rule/","title":"The Mostly True Naming Rule"},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/the-server-doesnt-render/":{"body":"When I advise people on how they should structure a web service, I always start from the same place:\nmake a server that responds to HTTP requests with HTML text.\n\nThat is the most durable, cost-effective, and user-friendly way to build a web service.\nMost web services should be built this way absent an excellent reason not to.\nUpon hearing this, web developers often reply ‚Äúoh, you like server-side rendering,‚Äù to which I usually wince and answer ‚Äúmore or less.‚Äù\nYou have to pick your battles when chipping away at a decade of miseducation.\nAt least people know what I‚Äôm talking about.\nBut ‚Äúserver-side rendering‚Äù is a horrible term.\nIt implies that the server is not just doing more work, but doing hard work, work that‚Äôs best left to the experts.\nNone of this is true.\nYou, too, can do server-side ‚Äúrendering,‚Äù with essentially no effort, in whatever programming language you prefer.\nOnce you understand that, you‚Äôll start to see the web the way I do: as the simplest, easiest, and most powerful interface for computation ever created.\nHTML is just text\nWherever you can print text, you can make HTML.\nHere‚Äôs an example in Python, which extends Python‚Äôs built-in HTTP server so that it responds to every GET request with the same text:\n&lt;h1&gt;Python webpage!&lt;/h1&gt;\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer\n\nWEBPAGE = \"&lt;h1&gt;Python webpage!&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\"\n\nclass HTMLServer(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):\n    def do_GET(self):\n        self.send_response(200)\n        self.end_headers()\n        self.wfile.write(str.encode(WEBPAGE))\n\nwebServer = HTTPServer((\"localhost\", 8080), HTMLServer)\nprint(\"Server running at http://localhost:8080\")\nwebServer.serve_forever()\n\nThis would be even simpler with flask, but I‚Äôm trying to make a point here by using a basic server without any dependencies.\nThere‚Äôs no magic that makes HTML text become HTML code.\nWe didn‚Äôt even set the Content-Type header to text/html.\nIt's good to set the Content-Type header, though, so the browser doesn't have to guess.\nRun that script and then try interacting with the server via curl.\nYou‚Äôll see that it‚Äôs just text.\n$ curl localhost:8080\n&lt;h1&gt;Python webpage!&lt;/h1&gt;\n\nWhat if we open http://localhost:8080 in a browser?\nInstead of showing plain text, the browser will render that HTML into something more dynamic.\nThe &lt;h1&gt; tags are gone and the remaining text is big and bold.\n\nTo incorporate color and a fun font, like we did in ‚ÄúThe Best ‚ÄòHello World‚Äô in Web Development,‚Äù simply add a &lt;style&gt; tag to the string.\nfrom http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer\n\nWEBPAGE = \"\"\"\n&lt;style&gt;\nbody {\n  background-color: lightblue;\n  font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Python webpage!&lt;/h1&gt;\n\"\"\"\n\n# Server code omitted for clarity\n\n\nNow curling the endpoint will show the additional style tag, and the browser will render the HTML with a nice blue background and a comic sans font.\n\nThe browser does the rendering\nDid you notice that I used the word ‚Äúrender‚Äù twice in the previous section?\nBoth times to refer to actions the browser took, namely the transformation of this text‚Äî\n&lt;style&gt;\nbody {\n  background-color: lightblue;\n  font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive;\n}\n&lt;h1&gt;Python webpage!&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n‚Äîinto a webpage.\n\nEven something as ‚Äúsimple‚Äù as rendering header text on a blue background is a very complicated process.\nChapter 3 of Panchekha &amp; Harrelson‚Äôs excellent book, Web Browser Engineering, has a basic introduction to the steps involved.\nLet‚Äôs drop in on the part where they talk about measuring text:\n\nRemember that bi_times is size-16 Times: why does font.metrics report that it is actually 19 pixels tall?\nWell, first of all, a size of 16 means 16 points, which are defined as 72nds of an inch, not 16 pixels, which your monitor probably has around 100 of per inch.\nThose 16 points measure not the individual letters but the metal blocks the letters were once carved from, so the letters themselves must be less than 16 points.\nIn fact, different size-16 fonts have letters of varying heights.\n\nOkay.\nJust getting a couple letters on the page requires layout math that most web developers have never even considered.\nAll this is learnable (that‚Äôs what the book is for), but web rendering is astoundingly complex.\nImagine trying to implement kerning;\ninstead, you get it for free.\nThe reason not to call HTML text generation ‚Äúrendering‚Äù is because rendering really is a difficult, complicated problem, it‚Äôs just not one the website author ever has to think about.\nBrowser engineers have taken care of it.\nThe required software in every person‚Äôs pocket.\nAll the website author has to do is print text surrounded by tags‚Äîno math required.\nExpressing data as HTML\nWhat is the appropriate framing for this concept, if not ‚Äúserver-side rendering?‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs text generation, yes, but more precisely: we are expressing our data as HTML text.\nNot only is this technique universally available without specialized tools, it‚Äôs kind of fun!\nboroughs = [\n  \"The Bronx\",\n  \"Manhattan\",\n  \"Brooklyn\",\n  \"Queens\",\n  \"Staten Island\"\n]\n\n# Using simple string operations,\n# we can express this list as HTML\nLIST = \"&lt;li&gt;\".join(boroughs)\nWEBPAGE = \"&lt;h1&gt;NYC Boroughs&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;\" + LIST + \"&lt;/ul&gt;\"\n\n\nNotice that I didn't include the closing &lt;/li&gt; tags. HTML doesn't actually require that you close list items, an affordance which is often discouraged but makes list items much easier to generate programatically.\nManipulating strings is Coding 101.\nLearn a couple HTML elements and you can use basic string operations to build an interactive view of whatever your code accomplishes.\nThe resulting text isn‚Äôt very pretty outside the browser, but inside the browser, it gets the job done.\n&lt;h1&gt;NYC Boroughs&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Bronx&lt;li&gt;Manhattan&lt;li&gt;Brooklyn&lt;li&gt;Queens&lt;li&gt;Staten Island&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n\nYou could, of course, choose to express the same dataset as JSON, using the same techniques.\nboroughs = [\n  \"The Bronx\",\n  \"Manhattan\",\n  \"Brooklyn\",\n  \"Queens\",\n  \"Staten Island\"\n]\n\nLIST = '\",\"'.join(boroughs)\nWEBPAGE = '{ \"nyc_boroughs\": [\"' + LIST + '\"] }'\n\n# Server code omitted for clarity\n\nAlthough, this doesn‚Äôt really accomplish all that much, because JSON doesn‚Äôt have hypermedia controls.\nBut it‚Äôs at least possible, if you need quick and dirty JSON output and don‚Äôt have access to a JSON library for some reason.\nObviously you should use python's JSON module for this task, but I have occasionally done stuff like this for personal scripts in bash or awk. It's good to remember you can!\n{ \"nyc_boroughs\": [\"The Bronx\",\"Manhattan\",\"Brooklyn\",\"Queens\",\"Staten Island\" ] }\n\nThe point is not that you should (necessarily) be generating HTML or JSON via string manipulation, it‚Äôs they both operate at similar levels of difficulty and abstraction;\nI object to the term ‚Äúserver-side rendering‚Äù because it implies otherwise.\nTo start ‚Äúserver-side rendering‚Äù all you have to do is format your data as HTML, and return that from the server.\nSo what do we call this?\nMy preferred term is ‚ÄúHTML APIs.‚Äù\nDevelopers are familiar with JSON APIs, and an HTML API works exactly the same way, only it returns HTML, instead of JSON.\n‚ÄúHTML responses‚Äù works too.\n(HTML APIs are also REST APIs, but if you say ‚ÄúREST APIs‚Äù then you‚Äôll have to send your coworkers a second article, so save that one for later.)\nA lot of people get hung up on the idea that HTML can‚Äôt be an API (Application Programming Interface), because HTML is meant to be read by humans and APIs are meant to be read by computer software.\nBut that isn‚Äôt quite true.\nTake a look at the NYC Boroughs list in both JSON and HTML, side-by-side.\n&lt;h1&gt;NYC Boroughs&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;The Bronx\n  &lt;li&gt;Manhattan\n  &lt;li&gt;Brooklyn\n  &lt;li&gt;Queens\n  &lt;li&gt;Staten Island\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n{\n  \"nyc_boroughs\": [\n    \"The Bronx\",\n    \"Manhattan\",\n    \"Brooklyn\",\n    \"Queens\",\n    \"Staten Island\"\n  ]\n}\n\nNeither of these is actually intended to be read by the end-user. The end-user is supposed to see a formatted list!\n\nHTML is a hypermedia format, so it contains structured data and a standard interface that the browser can render.\nJSON APIs only encode the data; they lack the representation.\nUsing an HTML API doesn‚Äôt move complexity from the client to the server‚Äîit eliminates the less-useful JSON representation altogether.\nFrom this perspective, the HTML API is a software-to-software communication protocol:\nthe software that the server is talking to is the user‚Äôs browser, instead of a client-side JavaScript application.\nThe user‚Äôs browser reads the HTML API, and renders it as a Graphical User Interface (GUI).\nThe website is the easy part\nWhen making real websites‚Äîrather than scripts‚Äîyou want to use tools that are slightly more advanced than string joins.\nA good place to start is with a template engine.\nTemplate engines are libraries for generating structured text.\nJinja is a very common one.\nIt lets you build HTML strings with basic control flow, like ‚Äúfor‚Äù loops.\n&lt;h1&gt;NYC Boroughs&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n  {% for borough in boroughs %}\n  &lt;li&gt;{{ borough }}\n  {% endfor %}\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\nJinja is cross-platform now, but there are many templating libraries with syntax that feels native to a particular language (e.g. rust, zig, ocaml, common lisp).\nThis is one of the great advantages of starting from ‚ÄúHTML is text‚Äù‚Äîyou can use whatever programming language you like best.\nIt‚Äôs important to use templates for professional web development because they are equipped with secure defaults for escaping user-generated content. (Essentially all content you dynamically insert into an HTML document should be escaped.)\nThey also have nice affordances for code re-use.\nOne of the best things about templates, however, is that they are easy to understand.\nThey are a straightfoward, stateless automation for building text output.\nIf text is missing, or escaped improperly, or in the wrong place, it‚Äôs usually quite simple to debug why.\nThese days, ReactJS supports HTML APIs, but a tremendously complicated architecture is required to do so.\nReact essentially transforms all your UX logic into progressively-loaded JSON and then back into HTML;\nit‚Äôs HTML generation with a bunch of additional intermediate steps.\nWhy do at all that when you could just generate the HTML in the first place?\n\nReact Server Components are the React team‚Äôs answer to the question that plagued the team throughout the 2010s. ‚ÄúHow to do data fetching in React?‚Äù\n\nBecause you want to use React.\nIf you love React and love using it‚Äîby all means.\nJust don‚Äôt mistake the complexity of React Server Components for complexity that is inherent to the web platform.\nWithout the requirement to use React, a stateless hypertext API (also known as a REST API), can achieve similar (better?) performance, without that complexity.\nWebsites are not hard.\nThere are many pitfalls to building a dynamic web service with logins, databases, user-generated content, and all that (it‚Äôs a professional skillset).\nThe website part, however, the expression of your server‚Äôs data as an interface to be rendered by the user‚Äôs browser, is quite easy.\nYou really can do it with almost no specialized tools.\nAfter all, it‚Äôs basically just string joins.\nThanks to Meghan Denny and Carson Gross for their feedback on drafts of this post.\nNotes\n\nA lot of Dan Abramov‚Äôs writing is very insightful‚Äî‚ÄúProgressive JSON‚Äù in particular is worth a read.\nTemplate engines can have static type checking too.\nWhile I will never understand the mind of the person who wants to build web applications in prolog, they are among us, and they‚Äôve built the tooling for it.\nIn experience, React advocates are quite defensive about the idea that anyone has ever suggested React was necessary for use-cases where a simple &lt;form&gt; would do.\nI don‚Äôt want to tilt at strawmen, so I‚Äôll just say that I‚Äôm aware of that perspective, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs true.\nAll the examples in this blog are static text, but interactivity is just a &lt;a&gt;, &lt;button&gt;, or &lt;script&gt; tag away.\nPeople who learned web development prior to ~2016 have no trouble with this concept. I usually just say ‚Äúit‚Äôs like Rails,‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs Java Server Pages.‚Äù (If you‚Äôre building in Java today though, check out Thymeleaf.)\n\n","id":"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/the-server-doesnt-render/","title":"The Server Doesn't Render Anything"},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/what-dynamic-typing-is-for/":{"body":"\nUnplanned Obsolescence is a blog is about writing maintainable, long-lasting software.\nIt also frequently touts‚Äîor is, at the very least, not inherently hostile to‚Äîwriting software in dynamically-typed programming languages.\nThese two positions are somewhat at odds.\nStatic Typing is Better For Maintainability\nDynamically-typed languages encode less information.\nThat‚Äôs a problem for the person reading the code and trying to figure out what it does.\nThis is a simplified version of an authentication middleware that I include in most of my web services:\nit checks an HTTP request to see if it corresponds to a logged-in user‚Äôs session.\nfunction authenticate(req) {\n  const cookieToken = req.cookies['token']\n  const user = req.db.get_user_by_token(cookieToken)\n\n  if (user) {\n    return user\n  } else {\n    throw new AuthorizationError()\n  }\n}\n\nPretty straightforward stuff.\nThe function gets a token cookie from the HTTP request, checks the database to see if that token corresponds to a user, and then returns the user if it does.\nLine 2 fetches the cookie from the request, line 3 gets the user from the database, and the rest either returns the user or throw an error.\n\n\n\nThere are, however, some problems with this.\nWhat happens if there‚Äôs no token cookie included in the HTTP request?\nWill it return undefined or an empty string?\nWill req.cookies even exist if there‚Äôs no cookies at all?\nThere‚Äôs no way to know without looking at the implementation (or, less reliably, the documentation).\nThat doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt an answer!\nA request with no \"token\" cookie will return undefined.\nThat results in a get_user_by_token(undefined) call, which returns undefined (the function checks for that).\nundefined is a falsy value in JavaScript, so the conditional evaluates to false and throws an AuthorizationError.\nThe code works and it‚Äôs very readable, but you have to do a fair amount of digging to ensure that it works reliably.\nThat‚Äôs a cost that gets paid in the future, anytime the ‚Äúmissing token‚Äù code path needs to be understood or modified.\nThat cost reduces the maintainability of the service.\nUnsurprisingly, the equivalent Rust code is much more explicit.\nfn authenticate(req: Request) -&gt; AuthStatus {\n  let cookie_token = match req.cookies.get(\"token\") {\n      Some(token) =&gt; token,\n      None =&gt; return AuthStatus::Failure(\"Token not included in request\")\n  };\n\n  match req.db.get_user_by_token(cookie_token) {\n      Some(user) =&gt; AuthStatus::Success(user),\n      None =&gt; AuthStatus::Failure(\"Could not find user for token\")\n  }\n}\n\nIn Rust, the tooling can answer a lot more questions for me.\nWhat type is cookie_token?\nA simple hover in any code editor with an LSP tells me, definitively, that it‚Äôs Option&lt;String&gt;.\nBecause it‚Äôs Rust, you have to explicitly check if the token exists;\nditto for whether the user exists.\nThat‚Äôs better for the reader too: they don‚Äôt have to wonder whether certain edge cases are handled.\n\nIt's possible to write sloppier Rust than this, but the baseline is quite a bit higher.\n\nRust is not the only language with a strict, static typing.\nAt every place I‚Äôve ever worked, the longest-running web services have all been written in Java.\nJava is not as good as Rust at forcing you to show your work and handle edge cases, but it‚Äôs much better than JavaScript.\nPutting aside the question of which one I prefer to write, if I find myself in charge a production web service that someone else wrote, I would much prefer it to be in Java or Rust than JavaScript or Python.\nWeb Development Has Lots of DSLs\nConceding that, ceteris paribus, static typing is good for software maintainability, one of the reasons that I like dynamically-typed languages is that they encourage a style I find important for web services in particular: writing to the DSL.\nA DSL (domain-specific language) is programming language that‚Äôs designed for a specific problem area.\nThis is in contrast to what we typically call ‚Äúgeneral-purpose programming languages‚Äù (e.g. Java, JavaScript, Python, Rust), which can reasonably applied to most programming tasks.\nMost web services have to contend with at least three DSLs: HTML, CSS, and SQL.\nA web service with a JavaScript backend has to interface with, at a minimum, four programming languages: one general-purpose and three DSLs.\n\n  Language    DSL? Purpose\n  HTML        Yes  Website layout and functionality\n  SQL         Yes  Data persistence and retrieval\n  CSS         Yes  Website design\n  JavaScript  No   Server logic and website functionality missing from HTML\n\nIf you have the audacity to use something other than JavaScript on the server, then that number goes up to five, because you still need JavaScript to augment HTML.\n\n  Language    DSL? Purpose\n  HTML        Yes  Website layout and functionality\n  SQL         Yes  Data persistence and retrieval\n  CSS         Yes  Website design\n  Java        No   Server logic\n  JavaScript  No   Website functionality missing from HTML\n\nThat‚Äôs a lot of languages!\nHow are we supposed to find developers who can do all this stuff?\nTwo Approaches to Language Proliferation\nExpanding The Bounds\nThe answer that a big chunk of the industry settled on is to build APIs so that the domains of the DSLs can be described in the general-purpose programming language.\nInstead of writing HTML‚Ä¶\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;Classic Movies&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful website.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n‚Ä¶you can write JSX, a JavaScript syntax extension that supports tags.\nconst header = &lt;h1&gt;Classic Movies&lt;/h1&gt;\nconst paragraph = &lt;p&gt;\n  Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful website.\n&lt;/p&gt;\nconst page = &lt;&gt;\n  {header}\n  {paragraph}\n&lt;/&gt;\n\nThis has the important advantage of allowing you to include dynamic JavaScript expressions in your markup.\nAnd now we don‚Äôt have to kick out to another DSL to write web pages.\nCan we start abstracting away CSS too?\nSure can! This example uses styled-components.\nconst Button = styled.button({\n  color: 'gray',\n})\n\nconst page = &lt;&gt;\n  &lt;h1&gt;Classic Movies&lt;/h1&gt;\n  &lt;p&gt;Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful website.&lt;/p&gt;\n  &lt;Button&gt;Round up the usual suspects.&lt;/Button&gt;\n&lt;/&gt;\n\nSorry, I just saw Casablanca again recently. That's the last one.\nThis is a tactic I call ‚Äúexpanding the bounds‚Äù of the programming language.\nIn an effort to reduce complexity, you try to make one language express everything about the project.\nIn theory, this reduces the number of languages that one needs to learn to work on it.\n\n  Language    DSL? Purpose\n  SQL         Yes  Data persistence and retrieval\n  JavaScript  No   Server logic, website layout, website functionality, and website design\n\nThe problem is that it usually doesn‚Äôt work.\nExpressing DSLs in general-purpose programming syntax does not free you from having to understand the DSL‚Äîyou can‚Äôt actually use styled-components without understanding CSS.\nSo now a prospective developer has to both understand CSS and a new CSS syntax that only applies to the styled-components library.\n\nI got hit with that library in a job interview a while back, and I spent five minutes trying to figure out how to express child selectors before the interviewer took pity on me and was like \"don't worry, I can tell you know CSS.\"\nWhich I do!\nLet me write it!\n\n\n  Language                DSL? Purpose\n  HTML                    Yes  Website layout and functionality\n  JSX                     Yes  Website layout and functionality\n  SQL                     Yes  Data persistence and retrieval\n  CSS                     Yes  Website design\n  styled-components       Yes  Website design\n  JavaScript              No   Server logic\n\n\nI suspect people are going to be more inclined to defend JSX than CSS-in-JS.\nDo you really need to know HTML to write JSX?\nYes, unless you want to re-implement functionality that's built into &lt;a&gt;, &lt;form&gt; &lt;details&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, etc.\nMany people waste enormous amounts of time and money doing exactly that.\n\nNot to mention, it is almost always a worse syntax.\nCSS is designed to make expressing declarative styles very easy, because that‚Äôs the only thing CSS has to do.\nbutton {\n  color: gray;\n}\n\nExpressing this in JavaScript is naturally way clunkier.\nconst Button = styled.button({\n  color: 'gray',\n})\n\nPlus, you‚Äôve also tossed the web‚Äôs backwards compatibility guarantees.\nI picked styled-components because it‚Äôs very popular.\nIf you built a website with styled-components in 2019, didn‚Äôt think about the styles for a couple years, and then tried to upgrade it in 2023, you would be two major versions behind.\nGood luck with the migration guide.\nCSS files, on the other hand, are evergreen.\nOf course, one of the reasons for introducing JSX or CSS-in-JS is that they add functionality, like dynamic population of values.\nThat‚Äôs an important problem, but I prefer a different solution.\nBuilding Good Boundaries\nInstead of expanding the bounds of the general-purpose language so that it can express everything, another strategy is to build strong and simple API boundaries between the DSLs.\nSome benefits of this approach include:\n\nDSLs are better at expressing their domain, resulting in simpler code\nIt aids debugging by segmenting bugs into natural categories\nThe skills gained by writing DSLs are more more transferable\n\nThe following example uses a JavaScript backend.\nA lot of enthusiasm for htmx (the software library I co-maintain) is driven by communities like Django and Spring Boot developers, who are thrilled to no longer be bolting on a JavaScript frontend to their website;\nthat‚Äôs a core value proposition for hypermedia-driven development.\nI happen to like JavaScript though, and sometimes write services in NodeJS, so, at least in theory, I could still use JSX if I wanted to.\nWhat I prefer, and what I encourage hypermedia-curious NodeJS developers to do, is use a template engine.\nThis bit of production code I wrote for an events company uses Nunjucks, a template engine I once (fondly!) called ‚Äúabandonware‚Äù on stage.\nOther libraries that support Jinja-like syntax are available in pretty much any programming language.\n&lt;h2&gt;Upcoming Events&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;table&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n  &lt;th&gt;Name\n  &lt;th&gt;Location\n  &lt;th&gt;Date\n  &lt;th&gt;Registration Deadline\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n\n{% for event in events %}\n&lt;tr&gt;\n  &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=\"/events/{{ event.event_id }}\"&gt;{{ event.name }}&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;td&gt;{{ event.location }}\n  &lt;td&gt;{{ event.date }}\n  &lt;td&gt;{{ event.registration_deadline }}\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n{% endfor %}\n&lt;/table&gt;\n\nThis is just HTML with basic loops ({% for event in events %}) and data access ({{ event.name }}).\nI get very frustrated when something that is easy in HTML is hard to do because I‚Äôm using some wrapper with inferior semantics;\nwith templates, I can dynamically build content for HTML without abstracting it away.\n\nNunjucks actually has no concept of HTML syntax; it's just providing the curly-brace functionality.\nYou could template anything you wanted with it.\n\nPopulating this template in JavaScript is so easy.\nYou just give it a JavaScript object with an events field.\nconst events = db.getUpcomingEvents()\nreq.render('events.html', { events })\n\nThat‚Äôs not particularly special on its own‚Äîmany languages support serialized key-value pairs.\nThis strategy really shines when you start stringing it together with SQL.\nLet‚Äôs replace that database function call with an actual query, using an interface similar to better-sqlite3.\nfunction getEvent(req) {\n  const events = db.all(`\n    SELECT event_id, name location, date, registration_deadline\n    FROM events\n    WHERE date start_date &gt;= date('now')\n    ORDER BY start_date ASC\n  `\n\n  req.render('events.html', { events })\n}\n\nI know the above code is not everybody‚Äôs taste, but I think it‚Äôs marvelous.\nYou get to write all parts of the application in the language best suited to each: HTML for the frontend and SQL for the queries.\nAnd if you need to do any additional logic between the database and the template, JavaScript is still right there.\nOne result of this style is that it increases the percentage of your service that is specified declaratively.\nThe database schema and query are declarative, as is the HTML template.\nThe only imperative code in the function is the glue that moves that query result into the template: two statements in total.\n\nDeclarative languages tend to have better backwards compatibility guarantees, but HTML and SQL in particular are phenomenal in this regard.\n\nDebugging is also dramatically easier.\nI typically do two quick things to narrow down the location of the bug:\n\nCMD+U to View Source - If the missing data is in the HTML, it‚Äôs a frontend problem\nRun the query in the database - If the missing data is in the SQL, it‚Äôs a problem with the GET route\n\n\nJetBrains IDEs are especially good at running parameterized SQL queries straight from the embedded-string source.\n\nThose two steps are easy, can be done in production with no deployments, and provide excellent signal on the location of the error.\nFundamentally, what‚Äôs happening here is a quick check at the two hard boundaries of the system:\nthe one between the server and the client, and the one between the client and the database.\nSimilar tools are available to you if you abstract over those layers, but they are lessened in usefulness.\nEvery web service has network requests that can be inspected, but putting most frontend logic in the template means that the HTTP response‚Äôs data (‚Äúdoes the date ever get send to the frontend‚Äù) and functionality (‚Äúdoes the date get displayed in the right HTML element?‚Äù) can be inspected in one place, with one keystroke.\nEvery database can be queried, but using the database‚Äôs native query language in your server means you can validate both the stored data (‚Äúdid the value get saved?‚Äù) and the query (‚Äúdoes the code ask for the right value?‚Äù) independent of the application.\nBy pushing so much of the business logic outside the general-purpose programming language, you reduce the likelihood that a bug will exist in the place where it is hardest to track down‚Äîruntime server logic.\nYou‚Äôd rather the bug be a malformatted SQL query or HTML template, because those are easy to find and easy to fix.\nWhen combined with the router-driven style described in Building The Hundred-Year Web Service,\nyou get simple and debuggable web systems.\nEach HTTP request is a relatively isolated function call: it takes some parameters, runs an SQL query, and returns some HTML.\nIn essence, dynamically-typed languages help you write the least amount of server code possible, leaning heavily on the DSLs that define web programming while validating small amounts of server code via means other than static type checking.\nRaising the Inference Bar\nTo finish, let‚Äôs take a look at the equivalent code in Rust, using rusqlite, minjina, and a quasi-hypothetical server implementation:\n#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]\nstruct Event {\n    event_id: String,\n    name: String,\n    date: String,\n    registration_deadline: String,\n}\n\npub async fn get_events(req: Request) -&gt; ServerResult {\n  let events = req.db.query_map(\"\n    SELECT event_id, name location, date, registration_deadline\n    FROM events\n    WHERE date start_date &gt;= date('now')\n    ORDER BY start_date ASC\n  \",\n  [],\n  |row| {\n    let event = Event {\n      event_id: row.get(\"event_id\")?,\n      name: row.get(\"name\")?,\n      date: row.get(\"date\")?,\n      registration_deadline: row.get(\"registration_deadline\")?,\n    };\n    Ok(event)\n  })?;\n\n  let context = context! { events };\n  let body = req.render(\"events.html\", context)?;\n  req.send(body)\n}\n\n\nI am again obfuscating some implementation details (Are we storing human-readable dates in the database? What‚Äôs that universal result type?).\nThe important part is that this blows.\nMost of the complexity comes from the need to tell Rust exactly how to unpack that SQL result into a typed data structure, and then into an HTML template.\nThe Event struct is declared so that Rust knows to expect a String for event_id.\nThe derive macros create a representation that minijinja knows how to serialize.\nIt‚Äôs tedious.\n\nWorse, after all that work, the compiler still doesn‚Äôt do the most useful thing: check whether String is the correct type for event_id.\nIf it turns out that event_id can‚Äôt be represented as a String (maybe it‚Äôs a blob), the query will compile correctly and then fail at runtime.\nFrom a safety standpoint, we‚Äôre not really in a much better spot than we were with JavaScript:\nwe don‚Äôt know if it works until we run the code.\nSpeaking of JavaScript, remember that code? That was great!\nconst events = db.all(`\n  SELECT event_id, name, location, date, registration_deadline\n  FROM events\n  WHERE date start_date &gt;= date('now')\n  ORDER BY start_date ASC\n`\n\nreq.render('events.html', { events })\n\nNow we have no idea what any of these types are, but if we run the code and we see some output, it‚Äôs probably fine.\nBy writing the JavaScript version, you are banking that you‚Äôve made the code so highly auditable by hand that the compile-time checks become less necessary.\nIn the long run, this is always a bad bet, but at least I‚Äôm not writing 150% more code for 10% more compile-time safety.\nThe ‚Äúexpand the bounds‚Äù solution to this is to pull everything into the language‚Äôs type system: the database schema, the template engine, everything.\nMany have trod that path; I believe it leads to madness (and toolchain lock-in).\nIs there a better one?\nI believe there is.\nThe compiler should understand the DSLs I‚Äôm writing and automatically map them to types it understands.\nIf it needs more information‚Äîlike a database schema‚Äîto figure that out, that information can be provided.\nQueries correspond to columns with known types‚Äîthe programming language can infer that events.name is of type SQLITE_TEXT.\nHTML has context-dependent escaping rules‚Äîthe programming language can validate that events.name is being used in a valid element and escape it correctly.\nWith this functionality in the compiler, if I make a database migration that would render my usage of a dependent variable in my HTML template invalid, the compiler will show an error.\nAll without losing the advantages of writing the expressive, interoperable, and backwards-compatible DSLs the comprise web development.\nDynamically-typed languages show us how easy web development can be when we ditch the unnecessary abstractions.\nNow we need tooling to make it just as easy in statically-typed languages too.\nNotes\nThanks to Meghan Denny for her feedback on a draft of this blog.\n\nLanguage extensions that just translate the syntax are alright by me, like generating HTML with s-expressions, ocaml functions, or zig comptime functions. I tend to end up just using templates, but language-native HTML syntax can be done tastefully, and they are probably helpful in the road to achieving the DX I‚Äôm describing; I‚Äôve never seen them done well for SQL.\nSqlx and sqlc seem to have the right idea, but I haven‚Äôt used either because I to stick to SQLite-specific libraries to avoid async database calls.\nI don‚Äôt know as much about compilers as I‚Äôd like to, so I have no idea what kind of infrastructure would be required to make this work with existing languages in an extensible way. I assume it would be hard.\n\n","id":"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/what-dynamic-typing-is-for/","title":"What Dynamic Typing Is For"},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/why-insist-on-a-word/":{"body":"A central concept to HTML, and hypertext theory more generally, is something called Representational State Transfer, a.k.a. REST.\nOver at htmx, a lot of the writing we do is based on REST theory.\nREST is a widely misunderstood term,\nand if you point that out to people, you will be told, repeatedly and sometimes quite irately: who cares?\nREST has a new meaning now‚Äîuse words the way people understand them and spare us the lecture.\n\nThat criticism is compelling‚Äîwho among us isn‚Äôt a little descriptivist at heart‚Äîbut sometimes the original, more precise meaning of a word is necessary to communicate something that the more common meaning can‚Äôt capture.\nTo move hypertext forward, we have to build on the best work of our predecessors in the field, and that‚Äôs impossible to do without engaging with what they said and how they said it.\nSo here‚Äôs what REST is, and why it matters that we call it that.\n\nA lot of my readers are also htmx blog readers, which has lots of REST explainers.\nFeel free to skip to the next section if you already feel comfortable with the concept.\n\nOne more (short) REST explainer\nREST stands for ‚ÄúRepresentational State Transfer.‚Äù\nIt‚Äôs an academic term from Roy Fielding‚Äôs PhD dissertation, describing the fundamental constraints that, in Fielding‚Äôs view, made the World Wide Web a successful distributed system.\nWeb browsers don‚Äôt always follow his constraints (Fielding is not a fan of cookies), but for the most part they do, and the thesis explains why that works.\nHere are the main constraints that make the web RESTful:\n\nA client-server architecture\nStateless requests; the client sends all relevant information each time\nThe server can specify whether a response is cacheable\nThe client and server communicate using a uniform interface\n\nThe first three are pretty intuitive.\nThe last one is craaaaazzyyyyy.\nIt means that the server can‚Äôt control which client you‚Äôre going to use to talk to it, so it has to describe its interface using some standard grammar.\nOn the web, that‚Äôs HTML.\n\nAs a counter-example: think about how games like League of Legends work.\nYou download a client application (the game) on your computer, and that client connects to the LoL servers.\nThe creator of the game controls both the server and the client used to connect to it.\nSee also: apps on your phone.\n\nThat probably seems natural to you now, because HTML exists and it works, but at the time it was revolutionary to imagine that not only would one markup language would be sufficient to describe completely different applications‚Äîlike banking or mapping or email‚Äîbut that the server would describe what the user is allowed to do, from scratch, on every single network request.\nLet‚Äôs re-use the bank account example from ‚ÄúHow Did REST Come To Mean The Opposite of REST?‚Äù by Carson Gross.\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;Alex's Bank Account&lt;/title&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;Account number: 12345&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Balance: $100.00 USD&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Links:\n    &lt;a href=\"/accounts/12345/deposits\"&gt;deposits&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"/accounts/12345/withdrawals\"&gt;withdrawals&lt;/a&gt;\n    &lt;a href=\"/accounts/12345/transfers\"&gt;transfers&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nThat‚Äôs the HTML page for a bank account.\nThe browser, upon receiving that, will render the following:\n\n\nNotice how the API response describes the current state (your bank balance) and what actions the user can take to alter that state (the links) in a format that the user can understand and interact with.\nIf you click on one of those links, it will show you a new page, with new data, and new actions.\nNo client-side state is necessary, because all the state is in the HTML you just got.\nMake a new request and get new state, all represented as hypertext: that‚Äôs Representational State Transfer.\nOpa!\nThis is in contrast with a JSON API (commonly, incorrectly, called RESTful), which is not self-describing:\n{\n    \"account_number\": 12345,\n    \"balance\": {\n        \"currency\": \"usd\",\n        \"value\": 100.00\n     },\n     \"status\": \"good\"\n}\n\nWhy isn‚Äôt that self-describing?\nWell, here‚Äôs what the browser will render if you send that.\n\n\nThe client (the browser) doesn‚Äôt know what to do with any of that information.\nIt‚Äôs just data‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt encode any actions.\nNot only is the client now responsible for turning this data into something the user can interact with, it‚Äôs no longer resilient to the API changing;\nif an API changes, the client also has to change to handle it.\nContrast that with the HTML response, where the HTML could change and the browser would simply render the new HTML into something humans are capable of interacting with, no questions asked.\nThat‚Äôs what it means for the API to be self-describing.\n\nA lot of people also really don't like calling HTML responses \"APIs,\" because it's meant to be consumed by humans, not computers.\nI'm actually a lot more sympathetic to this confusion, but that's how it's used in the literature and I don't have a better term for it at this time.\n\nREST is an intellectual heritage\nIn the year 2000, Roy Fielding publishes his dissertation.\nIn the year 2022, Carson Gross writes a blog post about how no one understands Roy Fielding‚Äôs dissertation.\nWhat happens in the intervening 22 years?\nWell, lots of people write APIs (like the JSON example above) that aren‚Äôt RESTful but call them REST.\nThis prompts Fielding to write the following on his blog, in 2008:\n\nI am getting frustrated by the number of people calling any HTTP-based interface a REST API. [‚Ä¶]\nWhat needs to be done to make the REST architectural style clear on the notion that hypertext is a constraint?\nIn other words, if the engine of application state (and hence the API) is not being driven by hypertext, then it cannot be RESTful and cannot be a REST API.\nPeriod. Is there some broken manual somewhere that needs to be fixed?\n\nI don‚Äôt know, Roy, maybe there is a broken manual.\nMaybe you needed to explain this somewhere other than a PhD dissertation, a famously non-approachable format.\nFielding publishes a response to this criticism just four days later:\n\nSo, when you find it hard to understand what I have written, please don‚Äôt think of it as talking above your head or just too philosophical to be worth your time. I am writing this way because I think the subject deserves a particular form of precision. Instead, take the time to look up the terms. Think of it as an opportunity to learn something new, not because I said so, but because it will do you some personal good to better understand the depth of our field. Not just the details of what I wrote, but the background knowledge implied by all the strange terms that I used to write it.\nOthers will try to decipher what I have written in ways that are more direct or applicable to some practical concern of today. I probably won‚Äôt, because I am too busy grappling with the next topic, preparing for a conference, writing another standard, traveling to some distant place, or just doing the little things that let me feel I have [‚Ä¶] earned my paycheck.\n\nTwo things stick out to me about this excerpt.\nThe first is that it is wildly pompous.\nThe second is that it is correct.\nNow, obviously, it is ridiculous to complain that no one understands you and also explicitly disavow the work of explaining it at a more approachable level.\nBut if he is in fact speaking exclusively to hypermedia experts, then he‚Äôs right that using the terms precisely is necessary to convey those concepts correctly.\nFielding concludes:\n\nFortunately, there are more than enough people who are specialist enough to understand what I have written (even when they disagree with it) and care enough about the subject to explain it to others in more concrete terms.\n\nAnd he‚Äôs right, that happened too.\nLeonard Richardson incorporated the ideas from Fielding‚Äôs thesis into a talk called ‚ÄúJustice Will Take Us Millions Of Intricate Moves,‚Äù which broke the ideas down into ‚Äúa formal vocabulary for talking about what you get when you put HTTP, URIs, and HTML together‚Äù.\nMartin Fowler saw that talk and explained it in a blog post, formalizing the ‚ÄúRichardson Maturity Model.‚Äù\nCarson Gross read Fowler‚Äôs blog and used the Richardson Maturity Model to explain how REST came to mean the opposite of REST.\nIf we decided that REST was a lost cause, and chose some other term to describe that set of ideas, not only would we have to re-explain a bunch of things, we‚Äôd deny our successors access to the intellectual heritage that produced the knowledge we‚Äôre trying to build on.\nHow are we supposed to stand on the shoulders of giants whose names we don‚Äôt know?\nREST is worth building on\nThe HTML we have today works well enough to build rich, interconnected information systems, with basic interactive elements.\nAnd REST remains very useful for evaluating the quality of those systems.\n\nGenerally speaking, reliable web applications stick as closely to hypertext APIs as possible, because self-description is inherently more resilient than coupling.\n\nBut the web has evolved to require more complex interactivity.\nI firmly believe it is possible to build that with architectures that are just as sturdy as plain old Web 1.0 sites are.\nDoing so just requires improving on HTML, and improving on REST.\nFor instance, REST has little to say about the purpose of HTTP methods like ‚Äúput‚Äù and ‚Äúpost.‚Äù\nBut I think HTTP methods are very important, because\nadding additional HTTP methods lets you describe additional actions on the same resource.\nThat makes it possible to build more complex applications with simple URL schemas, adding to the self-descriptive power of the hypertext while preserving REST‚Äôs core constraints.\nSo I‚Äôm working on that.\nI‚Äôm reading the web specs, the theses, and the blog posts of the great web thinkers, learning what they learned, and trying to add on to it.\nI think that I live in the generation where it becomes possible to use those principles to make web services as durable as bridges.\nWe‚Äôll see.\nBut if I‚Äôm wrong, well, at least I‚Äôm using words that make my work easier to find in the future, whenever the time is right.\nThanks to Carson Gross for his feedback on a draft of this article.\nNotes\n\nIt genuinely makes me laugh how many times Carson has written a REST explainer\n(2016,\n2020,\n2021,\n2022,\n2023).\n‚ÄúREST was good idea but it doesn‚Äôt work in practice‚Äù is a very funny talking point to me because RESTful web practices were wildly successful.\nIt‚Äôs the web!\nREST is literally just regular websites.\nREST has a lot of room to improve as an accessible set of guidelines for evaluating the efficacy of distributed hypertext systems, but that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to change.\nI do believe, unfortunately, that the Richardson Maturity Model impedes our ability to move forward with REST, since it blesses JSON APIs with a sort of ‚Äúmostly REST‚Äù status (Level 2) that is not terribly useful (it‚Äôs just a JSON API); all of the interesting properties of representational state transfer come with the hypermedia representation (Level 3).\nFowler more or less acknowledges this in the conclusion.\n\n","id":"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/why-insist-on-a-word/","title":"Why Insist on a Word"},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/talks/":{"body":"","id":"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/talks/","title":"Talks"},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/talks/building-the-hundred-year-web-service/":{"body":"\nMy UtahJS talk, ‚ÄúBuilding the Hundred-Year Web Service‚Äù, was put online this week!\nIt‚Äôs about how to build software infrastructure that lasts a very long time.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not a software engineer (very unlikely that you‚Äôre reading this blog if so, but it‚Äôs possible) the first 11 minutes of the talk are non-technical, and have some insights about the future of the internet that I hope to expand on soon, in other contexts.\nSo it‚Äôs worth watching up until that point, before I start explaining to web developers how I think they should be making web services.\n\nSummary\nThis is my first stab at publicly articulating something that has been on my mind for a while: is it possible to build software infrastructure with longevity and maintenance characteristics that rival those of physical infrastructure?\nA lot of people think this is basically impossible‚Äîour computational capabilities are increasing too rapidly, and our software is changing too frequently, that the only way to keep up is a constant and significant expenditure of resources.\nI disagree.\nIn the talk, I analogize this moment in software to the building of the Williamsburg Bridge.\nThe Williamsburg Bridge was conceived in the 1800s, and built with horse-drawn carriage in mind, yet we‚Äôve been able to adapt that structure to the needs of a 21st-century city (well, sort of;

Death of htmx‚Äù at Big Sky Dev Con.\n\nSummary\nThe thesis of the talk is that, with 30 years of real-world usage evidence, we have a clear\nunderstanding of HTML‚Äôs limitations as hypertext, and with just three small additions to HTML, we\ncan address most of the use cases that the declarative AJAX libraries (htmx,\nturbo/hotwire, unpoly,\npjax, etc.) exist to resolve.\nThese three additions are:\n\nSupport PUT, PATCH, and DELETE methods in forms\nAllow buttons to make HTTP requests on their own, without being wrapped in forms\nAdd the target attribute to buttons, and allow the response from links, forms, and buttons to replace arbitrary DOM elements, using CSS selectors in the target attribute\n\nIn the talk, I explain the importance of each, and describe at a high level how each addition should\nbe integrated alongside the existing HTML controls.\nI don‚Äôt have formal proposals for these yet, but I‚Äôm working on them! I‚Äôll update this space with\nlinks when they are available, and if you have thoughts or help to offer, definitely contact me.\nPost Script\nI think the talk went pretty well, and don‚Äôt have too many of the ‚Äúah, I forgot to say that one\nthing‚Äù regrets that inevitably hit the minute you walk off stage. But there are a couple themes that\nI want to highlight, alongside the main argument, about why vanilla HTML is not just one way to make\na website, but the most important one.\nPure HTML is the past and future of essential internet infrastructure\nWebsites implemented in pure HTML are not only comically easy to maintain, but they largely adhere\nto set of interface metaphors that all internet users understand. It‚Äôs remarkable how many people we\nwere able to teach concepts like page navigation and form submission. To the extent that your\nwebsite adds to these basic concepts, it shrinks the base of users who will feel comfortable\nnavigating it.\nWhile many businesses require additional interface metaphors and don‚Äôt care if a septuagenarian pensioner with an HP notebook can navigate them, government services and other crucial web infrastructure need to be accessible to the largest group of people possible.\nAccessibility should be a pit of success\nThe best way to get people to use interfaces that computers (and therefore screen readers,\nalternative controls, and other assistive technologies) can understand is to make to the ‚Äúright‚Äù elements capable of things that the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù elements are not. If a button can make HTTP requests without JavaScript but a &lt;div&gt; cannot, then a lot fewer people will use &lt;div&gt;s where they should be using &lt;button&gt;s.\nWhere possible, the most accessible way to build webpages should also be the easiest. If writing pure HTML is easy, expressive, and fun, then fewer people will turn to more complicated, less accessible solutions.\nDeclarative interfaces are more maintainable\n‚Ä¶for as long as the interface remains relevant. The SQL queries that you wrote 10 years ago work well with modern web stacks, and new features can be integrated seamlessly alongside old ones; the SOAP APIs, maybe not so much.\nPerhaps a better universal interface for the internet will come along soon, but it is a fairly good bet that if 10 years from now you were handed a frontend codebase that hadn‚Äôt been touched since 2024, you would want that codebase to be as close to pure HTML as possible.\n","id":"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/talks/life-and-death-of-htmx/","title":"The Life & Death of htmx"},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/talks/whats-left-for-frontend-engineers/":{"body":"\nI went back to Bozeman!\n\n\n\n\nSummary\nBuilding webservices with HTML APIs (aka MVC, aka server-side rendering, aka ‚Äúrails-style‚Äù) is gaining traction again, thanks to improvements in web standards and lightweight HTML-driven libraries like htmx.\nAlthough there will occasionally be reasons to go beyond what the platform provides, this will always be the architecture that best aligns with the core competencies of the web, and the platform is improving every day.\nBut if the backend engineers are writing HTML, what‚Äôs left for the frontend engineers?\nI propose a basic set of responsibilities for the browser specialists on the team.\n\nSetup the infrastucture - know how a template engine works, get it installed, and set up the basic page structure\nExtend HTML - write new custom elements that add declarative capabilities to your templates\nBe the browser expert - own the more complicated frontend problems‚Äîlike security and accessibility‚Äîand be up to date on the most future-proof ways to handle them\n\nAnd if you run out of things to do?\nWell, your backend colleagues are full-stack now‚Äîno reason you can‚Äôt be too.\nFurther watching\nA number of Big Sky Dev Con ‚Äô25 talks touched on similar ideas (hypermedia-mentum?), and if you enjoy this one, I recommend also checking out these others:\n‚ÄúHTML is stealing our jobs!‚Äù - Robbie Wagner\n‚ÄúExtending vs Scripting: Lessons from building the Hyperview client‚Äù - Adam Stepinski\n‚ÄúThe Platform and a Stylesheet (A path to Platform &amp; SPA Parity)‚Äù - Tony Ennis\n","id":"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/talks/whats-left-for-frontend-engineers/","title":"What's Left for Frontend Engineers?"}},"docInfo":{"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/about/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/behavior-belongs-in-html/":{"body":1553,"title":3},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/best-hello-world-web-development/":{"body":1073,"title":5},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/custom-html-has-levels/":{"body":1089,"title":3},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/hard-page-load/":{"body":1344,"title":5},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/less-htmx-is-more/":{"body":1287,"title":3},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/messy-pile-css/":{"body":946,"title":2},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/mostly-true-naming-rule/":{"body":1107,"title":4},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/the-server-doesnt-render/":{"body":1129,"title":4},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/what-dynamic-typing-is-for/":{"body":1761,"title":2},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/blog/why-insist-on-a-word/":{"body":1009,"title":2},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/talks/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/talks/building-the-hundred-year-web-service/":{"body":227,"title":5},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/talks/life-and-death-of-htmx/":{"body":323,"title":3},"https://unplannedobsolescence.com/talks/whats-left-for-frontend-engineers/":{"body":151,"title":4}},"length":17},"lang":"English"};
